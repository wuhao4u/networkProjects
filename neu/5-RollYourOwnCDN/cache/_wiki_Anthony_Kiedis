<p>On October 6, 2004, Kiedis published a memoir titled <i><a href="/w/index.php?title=Scar_Tissue_(book)&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Scar Tissue (book) (page does not exist)">Scar Tissue</a></i>, which he co-wrote with author <a href="/w/index.php?title=Larry_Sloman&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Larry Sloman (page does not exist)">Larry Sloman</a>.  The book was originally intended to be a collection of stories of his childhood drug use, but evolved into a complete autobiography.<sup id="cite_ref-Memoir_68-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Memoir-68">[68]</a></sup>  He further explained: "One would just kind of assume that with all the [drug] consumption that my memory would be a bit shoddy.  But it's actually pretty lucid, and better than both of my parents', or any of my friends'. My friends tried to recount these same stories, and they were like, 'Wow, I don't ... were we there?'"<sup id="cite_ref-Memoir_68-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Memoir-68">[68]</a></sup> The formation and recording of <i><a href="/w/index.php?title=Stadium_Arcadium&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Stadium Arcadium (page does not exist)">Stadium Arcadium</a></i> took place at "<a href="/w/index.php?title=The_Mansion_(recording_studio)&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="The Mansion (recording studio) (page does not exist)">The Mansion</a>", the former home of <a href="/wiki/Harry_Houdini" title="Harry Houdini">Harry Houdini</a> where the Chili Peppers had recorded their 1991 breakthrough <i><a href="/wiki/Blood_Sugar_Sex_Magik" title="Blood Sugar Sex Magik">Blood Sugar Sex Magik</a></i>.<sup id="cite_ref-69" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-69">[69]</a></sup>  Kiedis noted that during the recording process of the album "everybody was in a good mood. There was very little tension, very little anxiety, very little weirdness going on and every day we showed up to this funky room in the Valley, and everyone felt more comfortable than ever bringing in their ideas."<sup id="cite_ref-VH1_70-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-VH1-70">[70]</a></sup>  The album was released on May 9, 2006. In August 2007, the band decided to take a break from music.
</p><p>According to Kiedis, there was a collective decision "not [to] do anything Red Hot Chili Peppers-related for a minimum of one year. [...] We started in 1999, with the writing and the recording of <i><a href="/wiki/Californication_(album)" title="Californication (album)">Californication</a></i>, and we didn't really stop until the tour ended last year. We were all emotionally and mentally zapped at the end of that run."<sup id="cite_ref-71" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-71">[71]</a></sup>  Frusciante departed amicably from the group in order to pursue separate musical interests.  However, Kiedis and Flea decided to keep the band together, citing an "intuitive feeling" that compelled them to continue making music.<sup id="cite_ref-rollingstone1_72-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-rollingstone1-72">[72]</a></sup> On August 26, 2011, the Red Hot Chili Peppers released a tenth album, <i><a href="/w/index.php?title=I%27m_with_You_(album)&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="I'm with You (album) (page does not exist)">I'm with You</a></i>.

Kiedis said it was very emotional and the first person he told was his father Blackie, who cried when hearing the news.<sup id="cite_ref-73" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-73">[73]</a></sup> On January 11, 2012, the Chili Peppers announced that they were forced to postpone the U.S. leg of their <i><a href="/w/index.php?title=I%27m_with_You_tour&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="I'm with You tour (page does not exist)">I'm with You tour</a></i> due to multiple foot injuries suffered by Kiedis. Kiedis has been battling through foot injuries since 2006 when he injured his foot onstage and finally was able to have surgery during a break in the band's tour in January 2012.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Relationships">Relationships</span></h3>
<p>Kiedis' dating life has been well documented especially his relationships with women much younger than him. He also has held many relationships with famous musicians, actresses and supermodels including <a href="/wiki/Ione_Skye" title="Ione Skye">Ione Skye</a>, <a href="/wiki/Jessica_Stam" title="Jessica Stam">Jessica Stam</a>, <a href="/wiki/Heidi_Klum" title="Heidi Klum">Heidi Klum</a>, Lola Corwin, Jaime Rishar and Helena Vestegaard. Kiedis has been linked to women such as <a href="/wiki/Demi_Moore" title="Demi Moore">Demi Moore</a>, <a href="/wiki/Hope_Sandoval" title="Hope Sandoval">Hope Sandoval</a>, <a href="/wiki/Linda_Evangelista" title="Linda Evangelista">Linda Evangelista</a> and even <a href="/wiki/Madonna_(entertainer)" title="Madonna (entertainer)">Madonna</a> though it is unconfirmed if Kiedis had actually entered a romantic relationship with any of them. Some of Kiedis' former girlfriends have even inspired some of the songs he has written. <a href="/wiki/Nina_Hagen" title="Nina Hagen">Nina Hagen</a> inspired the 1983 demo song, "What It Is" aka Nina's Song. Singer Sinead O'Connor was the inspiration for 1991's "I Could Have Lied" while <a href="/wiki/Spice_Girls" title="Spice Girls">Spice Girls</a> singer, <a href="/w/index.php?title=Melanie_Chisholm&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Melanie Chisholm (page does not exist)">Melanie Chisholm</a> "Sporty Spice" inspired 1999's "Emit Remmus". Former girlfriend, Yohanna Logan was said to be Kiedis' soulmate. The 1999 outtake, "Fat Dance" was written about her and even mentions her name in the lyrics. Their spilt was also a heavy inspiration throughout the band's 2002 album, <i><a href="/wiki/By_the_Way" title="By the Way">By the Way</a></i>. The mother of Kiedis' son, Heather Christie was an inspiration for a few of the songs on the band's 2006 album, <i><a href="/w/index.php?title=Stadium_Arcadium&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Stadium Arcadium (page does not exist)">Stadium Arcadium</a></i> most notably the song, "She's Only 18".<sup id="cite_ref-80" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-80">[80]</a></sup>
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Drug_addictions">Drug addictions</span></h3>
<p>Kiedis has battled <a href="/wiki/Drug_addiction" title="Drug addiction" class="mw-redirect">drug addiction</a>, including heroin and <a href="/wiki/Cocaine" title="Cocaine">cocaine</a>, throughout his life.  Since his father was an addict, Kiedis was constantly around his drug-using and -dealing father, as well as his father's friends, who engaged in the same activities.  Some of Kiedis' early drug use came from substances he got from his father, including marijuana, which he first smoked when he was 11 years old.<sup id="cite_ref-Kiedis.2C_Anthony_2004_p._96_10-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Kiedis.2C_Anthony_2004_p._96-10">[10]</a></sup> He used drugs for years, even into the formation of the band, where other members were also using. A few years into the band's career he was briefly fired due to his heavy drug use and at times it got so bad he failed to show up to some of the band's performances. One night Kiedis decided to go out and score drugs which made him miss a performance so the band replaced him with singer <a href="/wiki/Keith_Morris" title="Keith Morris">Keith Morris</a>. He tried to get clean after Red Hot Chili Peppers guitarist <a href="/wiki/Hillel_Slovak" title="Hillel Slovak">Hillel Slovak</a> died of a heroin overdose (specifically using the method of <a href="/wiki/Speedball_(drug)" title="Speedball (drug)">speedballing</a>) on June 25, 1988, saying he would never shoot up again.<sup id="cite_ref-81" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-81">[81]</a></sup> He entered rehab and ended up staying clean for five years but relapsed in 1994, causing a major delay in the release of the band's 1995 album, <i><a href="/wiki/One_Hot_Minute" title="One Hot Minute">One Hot Minute</a></i> and kept using on and off over the next six years.
</p><p>The last major relapse was instigated by a doctor prescribing him <a href="/wiki/Ultram" title="Ultram" class="mw-redirect">Ultram</a> despite Kiedis specifically asking for drugs that are not in the opiate family. To a recovering heroin addict, the synthetic opiate only gave rise to strong cravings. This last relapse, as many previous ones, was to a degree also a byproduct of a tumultuous relationship with a woman. He has reportedly avoided another relapse since December 24, 2000. "It’s easy to be a junkie, but it's not easy to be one of the best guitarists or songwriters of all time," Kiedis said, referring to <a href="/wiki/John_Frusciante" title="John Frusciante">John Frusciante</a>, in the March 2007 issue of <i><a href="/wiki/Blender_(magazine)" title="Blender (magazine)">Blender</a></i>.<sup id="cite_ref-82" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-82">[82]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Bandhistory_83-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Bandhistory-83">[83]</a></sup> After over twenty years of speculation, in May 2012 Vulture Magazine stated that the location where Kiedis would purchase and use drugs, and that inspired, "Under the Bridge", is located in <a href="/wiki/MacArthur_Park" title="MacArthur Park">MacArthur Park</a> in Los Angeles, CA, based on clues taken from Kiedis' memoir. Kiedis had refused to divulge the location.<sup id="cite_ref-84" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-84">[84]</a></sup>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Artistry">Artistry</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Musical_style">Musical style</span></h3>
<p>While creating lyrics and melodies for the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Kiedis has drawn from various sources for inspiration.  His first musical memory was hearing <a href="/wiki/Neil_Young" title="Neil Young">Neil Young</a>'s "<a href="/wiki/Heart_of_Gold_(Neil_Young_song)" title="Heart of Gold (Neil Young song)">Heart of Gold</a>" at age eleven: "It moved me so much that I insisted my mother buy me the 45."<sup id="cite_ref-Mullen116_85-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Mullen116-85">[85]</a></sup>  In high school, he was highly influenced by the rap-style vocals of <a href="/w/index.php?title=Grandmaster_Flash_and_the_Furious_Five&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five (page does not exist)">Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five</a>'s "<a href="/w/index.php?title=The_Message_(Grandmaster_Flash_and_the_Furious_Five_song)&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="The Message (Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five song) (page does not exist)">The Message</a>" and the "in-your-face sexual lyrics" of <a href="/wiki/Prince_(musician)" title="Prince (musician)">Prince</a>'s "<a href="/w/index.php?title=Dirty_Mind_(song)&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Dirty Mind (song) (page does not exist)">Dirty Mind</a>".<sup id="cite_ref-Mullen78_86-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Mullen78-86">[86]</a></sup> Kiedis writes most of the Red Hot Chili Peppers' lyrics. Starting with 1989's <i><a href="/wiki/Mother%27s_Milk" title="Mother's Milk">Mother's Milk</a></i> album, <a href="/wiki/John_Frusciante" title="John Frusciante">John Frusciante</a> and Flea have written nearly all of the music (excluding melodies) for the Red Hot Chili Peppers, while Kiedis adds lyrics and melodies he hears during instrumental jams by his band mates. Kiedis said in 2006, "Somehow I find songs... in the bigness of what they're doing." His lyrical style has varied over the years. During the band's early years, Kiedis wrote many lyrics detailing his enjoyment of sex, drugs, and life in Los Angeles. As his musical tastes expanded and his outlook on life changed, he began writing songs about a wider spectrum of subjects. His lyrics include many of the same themes as the writings of <a href="/wiki/Charles_Bukowski" title="Charles Bukowski">Charles Bukowski</a>, Kiedis' main literary influence.<sup id="cite_ref-Bandhistory_83-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Bandhistory-83">[83]</a></sup>
</p><p>His early vocal style with the band primarily consisted of <a href="/wiki/Rapping" title="Rapping">rapping</a>. On <i>Mother's Milk</i> (1989), Kiedis wrote more melody-driven songs, rather than the basic rhythm and beat style of <a href="/wiki/Funk" title="Funk">funk</a>. The first song where Kiedis employed his new melodic style was "<a href="/w/index.php?title=Knock_Me_Down&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Knock Me Down (page does not exist)">Knock Me Down</a>". The melody was actually shaped and performed by guitarist John Frusciante. Upon joining the band, Frusciante sang lead vocals on the song along with Kiedis. <i><a href="/wiki/Blood_Sugar_Sex_Magik" title="Blood Sugar Sex Magik">Blood Sugar Sex Magik</a></i> in 1991 still saw Kiedis rapping, but he also started singing in songs such as "<a href="/wiki/Under_the_Bridge" title="Under the Bridge">Under the Bridge</a>", "<a href="/w/index.php?title=Breaking_the_Girl&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Breaking the Girl (page does not exist)">Breaking the Girl</a>", and "I Could Have Lied". Over the years, Kiedis grew to favor singing over rapping. Kiedis has had many <a href="/w/index.php?title=Vocal_coaches&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Vocal coaches (page does not exist)">vocal coaches</a>, but none of them had helped him sing "well." In fact, it was not until 1999's <i><a href="/wiki/Californication_(album)" title="Californication (album)">Californication</a></i> that he felt he could take full control of his voice while singing.<sup id="cite_ref-Bandhistory_83-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Bandhistory-83">[83]</a></sup> Despite the band's varied lineup, Kiedis remained and tried to keep the group together whenever it was about to fall apart. However, Kiedis himself was fired for around a month somewhere in 1986 because of his drug addiction; he was brought back into the band and stayed clean for, as he recalls, 53 days, after which he began abusing cocaine and heroin again.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Upcoming_television_series">Upcoming television series</span></h2>
<p>Kiedis is developing a series for <a href="/w/index.php?title=HBO&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="HBO (page does not exist)">HBO</a> based on his unconventional upbringing in Los Angeles. The show is expected to be loosely based on much of Kiedis' autobiography.

</p><p>According to a post by Blackie on his Facebook page, the <a href="/wiki/John_Sayles" title="John Sayles">John Sayles</a> script for the pilot episode was turned over to HBO on May 10, 2010.

John Sayles, who wrote a script for the HBO pilot is no longer involved in the project. <i><a href="/wiki/Entourage_(TV_series)" title="Entourage (TV series)">Entourage</a></i> producers, Esther Dawson and Mike Chester will still produce the series and Kiedis will also co-produce the series along with Bram Sheldon. It is unknown if the series will still follow the relationship between Kiedis and his father Blackie or if the entire autobiography will be the focus of the series.<sup id="cite_ref-89" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-89">[89]</a></sup> In 2013, Dammett briefly mentioned the status of the series, which will be based on both Anthony and Dammett's biographies.
