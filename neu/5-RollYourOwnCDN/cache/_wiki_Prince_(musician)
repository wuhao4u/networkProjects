<p>In 1975, Pepe Willie, the husband of Prince's cousin, Shauntel, formed the band <a href="/w/index.php?title=94_East&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="94 East (page does not exist)">94 East</a> with Marcy Ingvoldstad and Kristie Lazenberry. Willie hired André Cymone and Prince to record tracks with 94 East. Those songs were written by Willie and Prince contributed guitar tracks. Prince also co-wrote, with Willie, the 94 East song, "Just Another Sucker." The band recorded tracks which later became the album <i>Minneapolis Genius&#160;– The Historic 1977 Recordings.</i> Prince also recorded, but never released, a song written by Willie, "If You See Me" (also known as, "Do Yourself A Favor"). In 1995, Willie released the album <i>94 East featuring Prince, Symbolic Beginning,</i> which included original recordings by Prince and Cymone.
In 1976, Prince created a demo tape with producer Chris Moon in Moon's Minneapolis studio. Unable to secure a recording contract, Moon brought the tape to Minneapolis businessman Owen Husney. Husney signed Prince, at the age of 17, to a management contract and helped Prince create a demo recording at <a href="/wiki/Sound_80" title="Sound 80">Sound 80</a> Studios in Minneapolis using producer/engineer David Z. The demo recording, along with a press kit produced at Husney's ad agency, resulted in interest from several record companies including <a href="/wiki/Warner_Bros._Records" title="Warner Bros.

<p>In 1994, Prince's attitude towards his artistic output underwent a notable shift. He began to view releasing albums in quick succession as a means of ejecting himself from his contractual obligations to Warner Bros. The label, he believed, was intent on limiting his artistic freedom by insisting that he release albums more sporadically. He also blamed Warner Bros. for the poor commercial performance of the <i>Love Symbol Album</i>, claiming that it was insufficiently marketed by Warner. It was out of these developments that the aborted <i><a href="/wiki/The_Black_Album_(Prince_album)" title="The Black Album (Prince album)">The Black Album</a></i> was officially released, approximately seven years after its initial recording and near-release. The "new" release, which was already in wide circulation as a <a href="/wiki/Bootleg_recording" title="Bootleg recording">bootleg</a>, sold relatively poorly.
</p><p>Following that disappointing venture, Warner Bros. succumbed to Prince's wishes to release an album of new material, to be entitled <i><a href="/wiki/Come_(Prince_album)" title="Come (Prince album)">Come</a></i>. When <i>Come</i> was eventually released, it confirmed all of Warner's fears. It became Prince's poorest-selling album to date, struggling to even shift 500,000 copies. Even more frustrating was the fact that Prince insisted on crediting the album to "Prince 1958–1993."
</p><p>Prince pushed to have his next album <i><a href="/wiki/The_Gold_Experience" title="The Gold Experience">The Gold Experience</a></i> released simultaneously with <i>Love Symbol</i>-era material. Warner Bros. allowed the single "<a href="/w/index.php?title=The_Most_Beautiful_Girl_in_the_World_(Prince_song)&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="The Most Beautiful Girl in the World (Prince song) (page does not exist)">The Most Beautiful Girl in the World</a>" to be released via a small, independent distributor, <a href="/wiki/Bellmark_Records" title="Bellmark Records">Bellmark Records</a>, in February 1994. The release was successful, reaching No.3 on the U.S. <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100 and No.1 in many other countries, but it would not prove to be a model for subsequent releases. Warner Bros. still resisted releasing <i>The Gold Experience</i>, fearing poor sales and citing "<a href="/wiki/Market_saturation" title="Market saturation">market saturation</a>" as a defense. When eventually released in September 1995, <i>The Gold Experience</i> failed to sell well, although it reached the top 10 of the <i>Billboard</i> 200 initially, and many reviewed it as Prince's best effort since <i>Sign "O" the Times</i>. The album is now out-of-print.
<i><a href="/wiki/Chaos_and_Disorder" title="Chaos and Disorder">Chaos and Disorder</a></i>, released in 1996, was Prince's final album of new material for Warner Bros., as well as one of his least commercially successful releases. Prince attempted a major comeback later that year when, free of any further contractual obligations to Warner Bros., he released <i><a href="/wiki/Emancipation_(Prince_album)" title="Emancipation (Prince album)">Emancipation</a></i>, a 36-song, 3-CD set (each disc was exactly 60 minutes long). The album was released via his own <a href="/wiki/NPG_Records" title="NPG Records">NPG Records</a> with distribution through <a href="/wiki/EMI" title="EMI">EMI</a>. To publish his songs on <i>Emancipation</i>, Prince did not use <i>Controversy Music</i>&#160;– <i>ASCAP</i>, which he had used for all his records since 1981, but rather used <i>Emancipated Music Inc.</i><sup id="cite_ref-60" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-60">[60]</a></sup>&#160;– <i>ASCAP</i>.

</p><p>Prince released <i><a href="/w/index.php?title=Crystal_Ball_(album_set)&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Crystal Ball (album set) (page does not exist)">Crystal Ball</a></i>, a 5-CD collection of unreleased material, in 1998. The distribution of this album was disorderly, with some fans pre-ordering the album on his website up to a year before it was eventually shipped to them; these pre-orders were eventually delivered months after the record had gone on sale in retail stores. The retail edition has only four discs, as it is missing the <i>Kamasutra</i> disc. There are also two different packaging editions for retail, one being in a 4-disc sized jewel case with a simple white cover and the Love Symbol in a colored circle; the other is all four discs in a round translucent snap jewel case. The discs are the same, as is the CD jacket. The <i><a href="/wiki/Newpower_Soul" title="Newpower Soul">Newpower Soul</a></i> album released three months later failed to make much of an impression on the charts. His collaboration on <a href="/wiki/Chaka_Khan" title="Chaka Khan">Chaka Khan</a>'s <i><a href="/w/index.php?title=Come_2_My_House&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Come 2 My House (page does not exist)">Come 2 My House</a></i>, and <a href="/wiki/Larry_Graham" title="Larry Graham">Larry Graham</a>'s <i><a href="/w/index.php?title=GCS2000&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="GCS2000 (page does not exist)">GCS2000</a></i>, both released on the <a href="/wiki/NPG_Records" title="NPG Records">NPG Records</a> label around the same time as <i>Newpower Soul</i> met with the same fate, despite heavy promotion and live appearances on <i><a href="/wiki/Vibe_(magazine)" title="Vibe (magazine)">Vibe with Sinbad</a></i>, and the <a href="/wiki/NBC" title="NBC">NBC</a> <i><a href="/w/index.php?title=Today_(NBC_program)&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Today (NBC program) (page does not exist)">Today</a></i> show's Summer Concert Series.
</p><p>In 1999, Prince once again signed with a major label, <a href="/wiki/Arista_Records" title="Arista Records">Arista Records</a>, to release a new record, <i><a href="/wiki/Rave_Un2_the_Joy_Fantastic" title="Rave Un2 the Joy Fantastic">Rave Un2 the Joy Fantastic</a></i>. In an attempt to make his new album a success, Prince easily gave more interviews than at any other point in his career, appearing on MTV's <i><a href="/wiki/Total_Request_Live" title="Total Request Live">Total Request Live</a></i> (with his album cover on the front of the <a href="/w/index.php?title=Virgin_Megastore&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Virgin Megastore (page does not exist)">Virgin Megastore</a>, in the background on <i>TRL</i> throughout the whole show), <i><a href="/wiki/Larry_King_Live" title="Larry King Live">Larry King Live</a></i> (with Larry Graham) and other media outlets. Nevertheless, <i>Rave Un2 the Joy Fantastic</i> failed to perform well commercially. A few months earlier, Warner Bros. had also released <i><a href="/wiki/The_Vault:_Old_Friends_4_Sale" title="The Vault: Old Friends 4 Sale">The Vault: Old Friends 4 Sale</a></i>, a collection of unreleased material recorded by Prince throughout his career, and his final recording commitment on his contract with Warner Bros. The greatest success he had during the year was with the EP <i><a href="/w/index.php?title=1999:_The_New_Master&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="1999: The New Master (page does not exist)">1999: The New Master</a></i>, released in time for Prince to collect a small portion of the sales dollars Warner Bros. had been seeing for the album and singles of the original <i>1999</i>.
</p><p>The pay-per-view concert, <i><a href="/w/index.php?title=Rave_Un2_the_Year_2000&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Rave Un2 the Year 2000 (page does not exist)">Rave Un2 the Year 2000</a></i>, was broadcast on December 31, 1999 and consisted of footage from the December 17 and 18 concerts of his 1999 tour. The concert featured appearances by many guest musicians including <a href="/wiki/Lenny_Kravitz" title="Lenny Kravitz">Lenny Kravitz</a>, <a href="/wiki/George_Clinton_(musician)" title="George Clinton (musician)">George Clinton</a>, Jimmy Russell, and The Time. It was released to home video the following year.

<p>On May 16, 2000, Prince ceased using the Love Symbol moniker and returned to using "Prince" again, after his publishing contract with <a href="/w/index.php?title=Warner/Chappell_Music&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Warner/Chappell Music (page does not exist)">Warner/Chappell</a> expired. In a press conference, he stated that, after being freed from undesirable relationships associated with the name "Prince," he would formally revert to using his real name. Prince still frequently uses the symbol as a logo and on album artwork and continues to play a Love Symbol-shaped guitar.
For several years following the release of <i>Rave Un2 the Joy Fantastic</i>, Prince primarily released new music through his Internet subscription service, NPGOnlineLtd.com (later NPGMusicClub.com). Two albums that show substantive jazz influence were available commercially at record stores: 2001's <i><a href="/wiki/The_Rainbow_Children" title="The Rainbow Children">The Rainbow Children</a></i>, and the 2003 instrumental record <i><a href="/wiki/N.E.W.S" title="N.E.W.S">N.E.W.S</a></i> which was nominated for a <a href="/wiki/Grammy_Award_for_Best_Pop_Instrumental_Album" title="Grammy Award for Best Pop Instrumental Album">Best Pop Instrumental Album</a> Grammy Award. Another album of largely jazz-influenced music, <i><a href="/wiki/Xpectation" title="Xpectation">Xpectation</a></i>, was released via download in 2003 to members of the NPGMusicClub. <i>Xpectation</i> is jazz themed along with new age and atmospheric themes.
</p><p>In 2002, Prince released his first live album, <i><a href="/wiki/One_Nite_Alone..._Live!" title="One Nite Alone... Live!">One Nite Alone... Live!</a></i>, which features performances from the <a href="/w/index.php?title=One_Nite_Alone...Tour&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="One Nite Alone...Tour (page does not exist)">One Nite Alone...Tour</a>. The 3-CD box set, which also includes a disc of "aftershow" music entitled <i>It Ain't Over!</i>, failed to chart. During this time, Prince sought to engage more effectively with his fan base via the <a href="/w/index.php?title=NPG_Music_Club&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="NPG Music Club (page does not exist)">NPG Music Club</a>, pre-concert sound checks, and at yearly "celebrations" at <a href="/wiki/Paisley_Park_Records" title="Paisley Park Records">Paisley Park</a>, his music studios. Fans were invited into the studio for tours, interviews, discussions and music-listening sessions. Some of these fan discussions were filmed for an <a href="/w/index.php?title=Unreleased_Prince_projects&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Unreleased Prince projects (page does not exist)">unreleased documentary</a>, directed by <a href="/wiki/Kevin_Smith" title="Kevin Smith">Kevin Smith</a>. Smith discusses what happened during those days at length in his <i><a href="/wiki/An_Evening_with_Kevin_Smith" title="An Evening with Kevin Smith">An Evening with Kevin Smith</a></i> DVD.

On February 8, 2004, Prince appeared at the <a href="/wiki/Grammy_Award" title="Grammy Award">Grammy Awards</a> with <a href="/w/index.php?title=Beyonc%C3%A9_Knowles&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Beyoncé Knowles (page does not exist)">Beyoncé Knowles</a>.

In addition he performed "Red House" on the album <i><a href="/w/index.php?title=Power_of_Soul:_A_Tribute_to_Jimi_Hendrix&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Power of Soul: A Tribute to Jimi Hendrix (page does not exist)">Power of Soul: A Tribute to Jimi Hendrix</a></i>.
On February 19, <i><a href="/wiki/The_Tavis_Smiley_Show" title="The Tavis Smiley Show">The Tavis Smiley Show</a></i> broadcast included a performance of "Reflection" from Prince's <i>Musicology</i> album. Prince was accompanied by Wendy Melvoin, formerly of The Revolution.
</p><p>In April 2004, Prince released <i><a href="/wiki/Musicology_(album)" title="Musicology (album)">Musicology</a></i> through a one-album agreement with <a href="/wiki/Columbia_Records" title="Columbia Records">Columbia Records</a>. The album rose as high as the top five on a number of international charts (including the U.S, UK, Germany and Australia). The U.S. chart success was assisted by the CD being included as part of the concert ticket purchase, and each CD thereby qualifying (as chart rules then stood) towards U.S. chart placement. <i>Musicology</i> is R&amp;B and soul themed along with funk, pop, quiet storm, and rock. Three months later, <i><a href="/wiki/Spin_(magazine)" title="Spin (magazine)">Spin</a></i> named him the greatest <a href="/w/index.php?title=Frontman&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Frontman (page does not exist)">frontman</a> of all time.<sup id="cite_ref-65" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-65">[65]</a></sup>
That same year, <i>Rolling Stone</i> magazine named Prince as the highest-earning musician in the world, with an annual income of $56.5&#160;million,<sup id="cite_ref-66" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-66">[66]</a></sup> largely due to his <a href="/w/index.php?title=Musicology_Tour&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Musicology Tour (page does not exist)">Musicology Tour</a>, which <a href="/w/index.php?title=Pollstar&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Pollstar (page does not exist)">Pollstar</a> named as the top concert draw among musicians in U.S. The artist played an impressive run of 96 concerts; the average ticket price for a show was U.S.$61. Further highlighting the success of the album, Prince's <i>Musicology</i> went on to receive two Grammy wins, for <a href="/wiki/Grammy_Award_for_Best_Male_R%26B_Vocal_Performance" title="Grammy Award for Best Male R&amp;B Vocal Performance">Best Male R&amp;B Vocal Performance</a> for "<a href="/w/index.php?title=Call_My_Name_(Prince_song)&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Call My Name (Prince song) (page does not exist)">Call My Name</a>" and Best Traditional R&amp;B Vocal Performance for the <a href="/w/index.php?title=Musicology_(song)&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Musicology (song) (page does not exist)">title track</a>. <i>Musicology</i> was also nominated for Best R&amp;B Song and Best R&amp;B Album, while "<a href="/w/index.php?title=Cinnamon_Girl_(Prince_song)&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Cinnamon Girl (Prince song) (page does not exist)">Cinnamon Girl</a>" was nominated for <a href="/wiki/Grammy_Award_for_Best_Male_Pop_Vocal_Performance" title="Grammy Award for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance">Best Male Pop Vocal Performance</a>. The album became the artist's most commercially successful since <i><a href="/wiki/Diamonds_and_Pearls" title="Diamonds and Pearls">Diamonds and Pearls</a></i>, partly due to a radical scheme devised which included in Billboard's sales figures those that were distributed to each customer during ticket sales for the <i>Musicology</i> tour, with concert figures accounting for 25% of the total album sales.<sup id="cite_ref-67" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-67">[67]</a></sup>
<i>Rolling Stone</i> magazine has ranked Prince No.27 on their list of 100 Greatest Artists of All Time.<sup id="cite_ref-rollingstone2004_8-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-rollingstone2004-8">[8]</a></sup>

(page does not exist)">S.S.T.</a>" and the instrumental "Brand New Orleans," at <a href="/wiki/Paisley_Park_Records" title="Paisley Park Records">Paisley Park</a> in the early hours of September 2. Prince again performed all instrumental and vocal parts. These recordings were quickly dispersed to the public via Prince's NPG Music Club, and "S.S.T." was later picked up by <a href="/wiki/ITunes_Store" title="ITunes Store">iTunes</a>, where it reached No.1 on the store's R&amp;B chart. On October 25, <a href="/wiki/Sony_Music_Entertainment" title="Sony Music Entertainment">Sony Records</a> released a version of the single on CD.
</p><p>In late 2005 Prince signed with <a href="/wiki/Universal_Records" title="Universal Records">Universal Records</a> to release his album, <i><a href="/w/index.php?title=3121_(album)&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="3121 (album) (page does not exist)">3121</a></i>, on March 21, 2006 (3/21).

The immediate success of <i>3121</i> gave Prince his first No.1 debut on the <i>Billboard</i> 200 with the album.
To promote the new album, Prince was the musical guest on <i><a href="/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live" title="Saturday Night Live">Saturday Night Live</a></i> on February 4, 2006, seventeen years after his last <i>SNL</i> appearance on the 15th anniversary special and nearly 25 years since his first appearance on a regular episode in 1981, making Prince the only <i>SNL</i> musical guest to have that long of a gap between appearances. He performed two songs from the album, "<a href="/w/index.php?title=Fury_(song)&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Fury (song) (page does not exist)">Fury</a>" and "Beautiful, Loved &amp; Blessed," with <a href="/w/index.php?title=T%C3%A1mar&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Támar (page does not exist)">Támar</a>.

Seven winning tickets were placed inside <i>3121</i> CD packages in the U.S., and other tickets were given away in various contests on the Internet and around the world. On May 6, 2006, twenty-four prize winners (with a guest each) attended a star-studded private party and performance at Prince's home.

The NPG Music Club sent out an email, claiming that "in its current 4m there is a feeling that the NPGMC gone as far as it can go. In a world without limitations and infinite possibilities, has the time come 2 once again make a leap of faith and begin anew? These r&#160;?s we in the NPG need 2 answer. In doing so, we have decided 2 put the club on hiatus until further notice." On the day of the music club's shutdown, a lawsuit was filed against Prince by the British company HM Publishing (owners of the <a href="/wiki/Nature_Publishing_Group" title="Nature Publishing Group">Nature Publishing Group</a>, also NPG). Despite these events occurring on the same day, Prince's attorney has called it pure coincidence and stated that the site did not close due to the trademark dispute.<sup id="cite_ref-69" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-69">[69]</a></sup>
Prince appeared at multiple award ceremonies in 2006.

<p>In 1993, during negotiations regarding the release of Prince's album <i><a href="/wiki/The_Gold_Experience" title="The Gold Experience">The Gold Experience</a></i>, a legal battle ensued between Warner Bros. and Prince over the artistic and financial control of Prince's output. During the lawsuit, Prince appeared in public with the word "slave" written on his cheek. Prince explained his name change as follows:
</p>
<blockquote class="templatequote">The first step I have taken toward the ultimate goal of emancipation from the chains that bind me to Warner Bros. was to change my name from Prince to the Love Symbol. Prince is the name that my mother gave me at birth. Warner Bros. took the name, trademarked it, and used it as the main marketing tool to promote all of the music that I wrote. The company owns the name Prince and all related music marketed under Prince. I became merely a pawn used to produce more money for Warner Bros...
<p>I was born Prince and did not want to adopt another conventional name. The only acceptable replacement for my name, and my identity, was the Love Symbol, a symbol with no pronunciation, that is a representation of me and what my music is about. This symbol is present in my work over the years; it is a concept that has evolved from my frustration; it is who I am. It is my name.<sup id="cite_ref-126" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-126">[126]</a></sup>
