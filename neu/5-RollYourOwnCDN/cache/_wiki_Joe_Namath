</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Super_Bowl_III">Super Bowl III</span></h3>
<p>A high point in his career was his performance in the Jets' 16–7 win over the <a href="/w/index.php?title=History_of_the_Indianapolis_Colts&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="History of the Indianapolis Colts (page does not exist)">Baltimore Colts</a> in the third Super Bowl in January 1969, which was before the AFL-NFL merger. Namath was named MVP of Super Bowl III. This win would make him the first  quarterback to ever start and win a national championship game in college, and to start and win a major professional league championship and a Super Bowl. The Colts were touted as "the greatest football team in history". Former NFL star and coach <a href="/wiki/Norm_Van_Brocklin" title="Norm Van Brocklin">Norm Van Brocklin</a> ridiculed the AFL before the game, saying "This will be Namath's first Professional Football game." Writers from NFL cities insisted it would take the AFL several more years to be truly competitive with the NFL. Much of the hype surrounding the game was related to how it would either prove or disprove the proposition that the AFL teams were truly worthy of being allowed to <a href="/w/index.php?title=AFL-NFL_Merger&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="AFL-NFL Merger (page does not exist)">merge with the NFL</a>; the first two such games had resulted in blowout victories for the NFL champion in the two previous years, the <a href="/wiki/Green_Bay_Packers" title="Green Bay Packers">Green Bay Packers</a>, and the Colts were even more favored by media figures and handicappers than the Packers had been.
</p><p>Three days before the game, Namath responded to a heckler in Miami with the now-famous line: "We’re going to win Sunday. I guarantee it."<sup id="cite_ref-zinser_10-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-zinser-10">[10]</a></sup>  His prediction was initially ignored, but it became legendary after the Jets' upset of the Colts.<sup id="cite_ref-zinser_10-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-zinser-10">[10]</a></sup>
</p><p>In the game, however, Namath backed up his boast and showed that his success against tough American Football League competition had more than prepared him to take on the NFL. The Colts' vaunted defense was unable to contain the Jets' running or passing game, while their ineffective offense gave up four <a href="/wiki/Interception" title="Interception">interceptions</a> to the Jets. Namath was the game's <a href="/w/index.php?title=Super_Bowl_MVP&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Super Bowl MVP (page does not exist)">MVP</a>, completing eight passes to <a href="/w/index.php?title=George_Sauer,_Jr.&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="George Sauer, Jr. (page does not exist)">George Sauer</a> alone, for 133 yards. Namath acquired legendary status for American Football League fans as the symbol of their league's legitimacy.  When he was asked by reporters after the game whether the Colts' defense was the "toughest he had ever faced", Namath responded "That would be the <a href="/wiki/Buffalo_Bills" title="Buffalo Bills">Buffalo Bills</a>' defense."  The American Football League's Bills had intercepted Namath five times, three for touchdowns, in the Bills' only win that <a href="/w/index.php?title=1968_AFL_season&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="1968 AFL season (page does not exist)">1968 AFL season</a>.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Bachelors_III">Bachelors III</span></h3>
<p>After the season, Namath opened a popular <a href="/wiki/Upper_East_Side" title="Upper East Side">Upper East Side</a> <a href="/wiki/Bar_(establishment)" title="Bar (establishment)">bar</a> called "Bachelors III", with plans to open branches in Florida and Boston. To protect the league's reputation, the NFL Commissioner, <a href="/wiki/Pete_Rozelle" title="Pete Rozelle">Pete Rozelle</a>, ordered Namath to divest himself of his interest in the bar. Namath reacted defiantly, retiring from football during a teary news conference. Eventually Namath agreed to divest his interest in the New York location.  After missing most of training camp, Namath came out of retirement and reported to the Jets.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Monday_Night_Football.27s_inaugural_game"><i>Monday Night Football'</i>s inaugural game</span></h3>
<p>The head of <a href="/wiki/American_Broadcasting_Company" title="American Broadcasting Company">ABC</a>'s televised sports, <a href="/wiki/Roone_Arledge" title="Roone Arledge">Roone Arledge</a>, made sure that <i><a href="/wiki/Monday_Night_Football" title="Monday Night Football">Monday Night Football</a>'</i>s inaugural game (September 21, 1970) would feature Namath and the New York Jets in a game against the <a href="/wiki/Cleveland_Browns" title="Cleveland Browns">Cleveland Browns</a> in <a href="/wiki/Cleveland_Municipal_Stadium" title="Cleveland Municipal Stadium" class="mw-redirect">Cleveland Municipal Stadium</a>. A record crowd of 85,703 and a huge television audience (but not shown in Cleveland, due to blackout rules which prevented games from being shown near the home stadium) watched the Jets set a team record for penalties and lose on a late Namath interception.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Injuries">Injuries</span></h3>
<p>After not missing a single game because of injury in his first five years in the league, Namath played in just 28 of 58 possible games because of various injuries between 1970 and 1973 as the Jets struggled with records of 4&#8211;10, 6&#8211;8, 7&#8211;7, and 4&#8211;10.  His most memorable moment in those four seasons came on September 24, 1972 in Baltimore, when he and boyhood idol <a href="/wiki/Johnny_Unitas" title="Johnny Unitas">Johnny Unitas</a> combined for 872 passing yards. Namath bombed the Colts for 496 yards and six touchdowns in a 44–34 victory, New York's first victory over Baltimore since Super Bowl III. In that same game, Unitas threw for 376 yards and three touchdowns. This game is considered by many NFL experts to be the finest display of passing in a single game in league history.<sup id="cite_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11">[11]</a></sup>
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Improving_the_Jets.27_level_of_play">Improving the Jets' level of play</span></h3>
<p>When he played, Namath always managed to improve the Jets' level of play. In a 1974 game against city rival <a href="/wiki/New_York_Giants" title="New York Giants">New York Giants</a> (played at the <a href="/wiki/Yale_Bowl" title="Yale Bowl">Yale Bowl</a> in <a href="/wiki/New_Haven" title="New Haven" class="mw-redirect">New Haven</a>, <a href="/wiki/Connecticut" title="Connecticut">Connecticut</a> as <a href="/wiki/Yankee_Stadium_(1923)" title="Yankee Stadium (1923)">Yankee Stadium</a> was closed for a massive renovation and <a href="/wiki/Giants_Stadium" title="Giants Stadium">Giants Stadium</a> was under construction), Namath scored a game-tying touchdown on a five-yard <a href="/wiki/Bootleg_play" title="Bootleg play">bootleg</a>, and then hit <a href="/w/index.php?title=Emerson_Boozer&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Emerson Boozer (page does not exist)">Emerson Boozer</a> with a touchdown pass in overtime to lift the Jets to a 26–20 victory (the first regular season game in NFL history to be decided in overtime), launching New York on a six-game winning streak to end the 1974 season at 7–7.
</p><p>The <a href="/wiki/Chicago_Winds" title="Chicago Winds">Chicago Winds</a> of the <a href="/wiki/World_Football_League" title="World Football League">World Football League</a> famously made a large overture to Namath prior to the start of the 1975 season in an effort to get Namath to sign with the team. The Winds designed their uniforms identically to that of the Jets and offered Namath $600,000 a year for three years, $100,000 for the next seventeen, a $500,000 signing bonus, and the eventual arrangement for Namath to revive the WFL's <a href="/wiki/Charlotte_Hornets_(WFL)" title="Charlotte Hornets (WFL)">New York franchise</a> as the new team's owner. The WFL's television provider, <a href="/wiki/TVS_Television_Network" title="TVS Television Network">TVS Television Network</a>, insisted on the Winds succeeding in signing Namath in order for the network to continue television broadcasts; Namath, in turn, requested a cut of the league's television revenue. The league refused, and Namath instead returned to the Jets. The Winds' failure to sign Namath made them look foolish.  Not only had all but promised Namath was coming to Chicago, but they had changed their colors to a green-and-white scheme mirroring that of the Jets. The Winds folded five weeks into the 1975 WFL season.  In part due to being without a national television contract, the WFL collapsed altogether a month later.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Los_Angeles_Rams">Los Angeles Rams</span></h3>
<p>In the twilight of his career, Namath was waived by the Jets to facilitate his move to the Los Angeles Rams when a trade could not be worked out. He was signed by the Rams on May 12, 1977. Namath hoped to revitalize his career, but by this point his effectiveness as a quarterback was greatly reduced by his knee injuries, a bad <a href="/wiki/Hamstring" title="Hamstring">hamstring</a>, and the general ravages of a long period of time playing professional football, as well as his "hard and fast" lifestyle. After playing well in a 2–1 start, Namath took a beating on a cold, windy, and rainy Monday night game in a one-point loss at the <a href="/wiki/Chicago_Bears" title="Chicago Bears">Chicago Bears</a>, throwing two interceptions, with another being nullified by a penalty,<sup id="cite_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12">[12]</a></sup> and was through for the regular season.
</p><p>He did not play again, but redemption and a Hollywood ending was there for the taking. After a disastrous three quarters of turnovers and only trailing by seven points in the opening round of the playoffs, head coach <a href="/w/index.php?title=Chuck_Knox&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Chuck Knox (page does not exist)">Chuck Knox</a> seemed ready to pull <a href="/wiki/Pat_Haden" title="Pat Haden">Pat Haden</a> and insert Namath. Rams assistant coach <a href="/w/index.php?title=Kay_Stephenson&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Kay Stephenson (page does not exist)">Kay Stephenson</a> said Namath looked great warming-up in the third quarter and advised Knox to put him in. The television audience was on the edge of their seats as it appeared Namath would replace Pat Haden and save the Rams' season. But Knox hesitated. Haden's problems continued and the Rams lost to the Vikings by a score of 14–7 in a sea of mud at the <a href="/wiki/Los_Angeles_Memorial_Coliseum" title="Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum">Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum</a>. Namath retired from the Rams after a single season.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Hall_of_Fame_legacy">Hall of Fame legacy</span></h3>
<p>Namath is in the Professional Football Hall of Fame.  While his career statistics are not exceptional (e.g.: Career passing percentage 50.1, QB rating 65.5, 50 more interceptions than TD's), Namath was the game's first true media superstar, and also the first quarterback to throw for 4,000 yards during the 14-game 1967 season.  Nobody achieved this feat again until <a href="/wiki/Dan_Fouts" title="Dan Fouts">Dan Fouts</a> in 1979, a year after the NFL adopted a 16-game season format and enacted new rules that gave more protection to quarterbacks and wide receivers. Namath's style of play in the years before his knees limited his mobility helped evolve the quarterback position in the NFL, and also initiated a gradual change in the typical style of an NFL offense from a run-oriented ball control game to a more open passing style.  Hall of Fame coach Bill Walsh stated that Namath was "the most beautiful, accurate, stylish passer with the quickest release [he'd] ever seen."  Hall of Fame coach Don Shula stated that Namath was "one of the three smartest quarterbacks of all time."

</p><p>In 2006, Namath enrolled in the University of Alabama's External Degree program (he was 15 credits shy of graduating when he left Alabama in 1965).

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Icon_and_advertisements">Icon and advertisements</span></h2>
<p>Namath's nickname "Broadway Joe" was given to him by <a href="/w/index.php?title=Sherman_Plunkett&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Sherman Plunkett (page does not exist)">Sherman Plunkett</a>, a Jets teammate. The "Joe Willie Namath" moniker, Namath's full given name, was popularized by sportscaster <a href="/wiki/Howard_Cosell" title="Howard Cosell">Howard Cosell</a>. He originated the fad of wearing a full-length fur coat on the sidelines, a habit which was adopted by many players after him. The NFL has since banned this, requiring all team personnel (players, coaches, athletic trainers, etc.) to wear league-approved team apparel. Namath stood out from other AFL and NFL players by wearing low-cut white shoes rather than traditional black high-tops (thus the nickname "Joe Willie Whiteshoes"). Today, the NFL often fines players for not wearing shoes that match those of their teammates.
</p><p>Namath also appeared in television advertisements both during and after his playing career, most notably for <a href="/w/index.php?title=Noxzema&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Noxzema (page does not exist)">Noxzema</a> shaving cream (in which he was shaved by a then-unknown <a href="/wiki/Farrah_Fawcett" title="Farrah Fawcett">Farrah Fawcett</a> <a href="/w/index.php?title=Template:YouTube&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Template:YouTube (page does not exist)">Template:YouTube</a>) and <a href="/w/index.php?title=Hanes&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Hanes (page does not exist)">Hanes</a> Beautymist pantyhose; both commercials contributed to his becoming something of a pop-culture icon.  He has appeared in advertising as recently as 2003.
</p><p>Namath also opened several bars under the name Broadway Joe's in both New York City and in <a href="/wiki/Tuscaloosa,_Alabama" title="Tuscaloosa, Alabama">Tuscaloosa, Alabama</a> (location of the University of Alabama). These continue today with moderate success.
</p><p>Namath spent many years appearing as a booster for golf tournaments and other good causes,  such as youth camps, including football camps, and lately for arthritis.  He has served as a <a href="/wiki/March_of_Dimes" title="March of Dimes">March of Dimes</a> volunteer for over 40 years.  Most recently, he was the March of Dimes' WalkAmerica Honorary Chair from 1998&#8211;2007.  He also holds a celebrity golf outing annually on Long Island, New York to benefit the March of Dimes.
</p><p>Namath made many notable remarks during the NFL Films presentation of NFL 75 Seasons.  Recounting his 1969 Super Bowl performance, he said "It was such a feeling of elation, joy, tickling explosions inside, the teammates we did it, we were #1." "The same three words keep coming back: 'We did it. WE DID IT.'"  Namath's infectious and genuine joy at recounting this made it natural for NFL Films to feature this quote in advertisements for its series.
</p><p>Talking about the Raiders he said, "You were always playing a tough football team, and some of the guys cheated.  Some of the guys kicked and bit and hit ya in the back, some of that kind of stuff, hit ya in the back of the head, and it's on film."
</p><p>Talking about "The Guarantee," Namath said, "[I]t was not planned, it wasn't premeditated; it was just anger and frustration, and I really believed we were gonna win the game."
</p><p>Speaking about teamwork, Namath said: "Life isn't always easy, and football isn't always easy. Football convinced me that life is a team game."
