</p><p>After spending a year and a half with WCW as a heel, Cactus Jack transitioned into a fan favorite after engaging in a feud with Paul Orndorff, Harley Race and Big Van Vader. Jack and Orndorff wrestled each other in a match for a spot on WCW Champion Vader's team at a Clash of Champions event. After the match, Race and Orndorff beat up Jack. At the following Clash of Champions event, Cactus Jack helped Sting's team win the match. He engaged in a feud with Orndorff, winning a falls-count-anywhere match against Orndorff at Superbrawl III. He then moved on to face Vader.
</p><p>Cactus Jack wrestled <a href="/wiki/Big_Van_Vader" title="Big Van Vader">Vader</a> on April 6, 1993, winning by count-out, but being severely beaten in the process. As a result, in the rematch with Vader on April 24, the two executed a dangerous spot to sell a storyline injury. Vader removed the protective mats at ringside and <a href="/wiki/Powerbomb" title="Powerbomb">powerbombed</a> Cactus onto the exposed concrete floor, causing a legitimate concussion and causing Foley to temporarily lose sensation in his left foot.<sup id="cite_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-24">[24]</a></sup> While Foley was away, WCW ran an <a href="/w/index.php?title=List_of_professional_wrestling_terms&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="List of professional wrestling terms (page does not exist)">angle</a> where Cactus Jack's absence was explained with a <a href="/wiki/Farce" title="Farce">farcical</a> comedy storyline in which he went crazy, was institutionalized, escaped, and developed amnesia.<sup id="cite_ref-mf248_25-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-mf248-25">[25]</a></sup> Foley had wanted the injury storyline to be very serious and generate genuine sympathy for him before his return.

</p><p>In one of WCW's most brutal matches of all time, Cactus faced Vader in a <a href="/wiki/Professional_wrestling_match_types#Last_Man_Standing_match" title="Professional wrestling match types">Texas Death match</a> at <a href="/wiki/Halloween_Havoc#1993" title="Halloween Havoc">Halloween Havoc</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-26">[26]</a></sup> Race won the match for Vader by using a cattle prod on Cactus, knocking him out. The level of violence involved in this feud caused WCW to refuse to book Cactus Jack against Vader on a pay-per-view again. On March 16, 1994, during a WCW European tour, Foley and Vader had one of the most infamous matches in wrestling history in <a href="/wiki/Munich" title="Munich">Munich</a>, Germany. Foley began a hangman, a planned move where a wrestler's head is tangled between the top two ring ropes. The spot is usually painful but safe (though in WCW the danger factor was raised slightly because their ring ropes were not actual ropes, but elevator cables encased with rubber).<sup id="cite_ref-mf4_27-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-mf4-27">[27]</a></sup> Unbeknownst to Foley, however, <a href="/wiki/2_Cold_Scorpio" title="2 Cold Scorpio">2 Cold Scorpio</a> had earlier complained that the ropes were too loose, resulting in the ring staff tightening the ropes to the maximum.<sup id="cite_ref-mf4_27-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-mf4-27">[27]</a></sup> When Foley performed the move, he found himself trapped in a position where the ropes were constricting the <a href="/wiki/Blood_flow" title="Blood flow">blood</a> to his <a href="/wiki/Brain" title="Brain">brain</a>, which he realised would quickly result in <a href="/w/index.php?title=Cerebral_anoxia&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Cerebral anoxia (page does not exist)">cerebral anoxia</a>, potential <a href="/wiki/Brain_damage" title="Brain damage">brain damage</a> and even <a href="/wiki/Death" title="Death">death</a>.

Foley chose to wrestle and won his only championship in WCW. Later on, Foley was frustrated by WCW's reluctance to work a storyline around losing his ear.
</p><p>WCW also shared a brief co-promotion with ECW during this time in which Foley represented WCW on ECW television as the WCW Tag Team champion. During a promo, Foley spat on his Tag Team title belt and threw it to the ground to appeal to the hardcore fans who frowned upon the mainstream promotions.

The final, against Terry Funk, was a barbed-wire rope, barbed-wire and <a href="/wiki/C-4_(explosive)" title="C-4 (explosive)">C4</a> board, time-bomb death match, which Cactus Jack won with help from <a href="/w/index.php?title=Tiger_Jeet_Singh&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Tiger Jeet Singh (page does not exist)">Tiger Jeet Singh</a>.

McMahon, displeased with the outcome, required Foley to prove he deserved another shot at Austin's title with a number one contendership match against his former partner, Terry Funk. The match was both the WWF's first ever "<a href="/wiki/Hardcore_wrestling" title="Hardcore wrestling">Hardcore match</a>" and the first time that Foley wrestled under his own name.

<p>On that same episode of Raw, Foley then reverted to his Mankind character, who began wearing an untucked shirt with a loose necktie and started the feud with <a href="/wiki/The_Undertaker" title="The Undertaker">The Undertaker</a>. At <a href="/w/index.php?title=King_of_the_Ring_(1998)&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="King of the Ring (1998) (page does not exist)">King of the Ring</a>, the two competed in the third <a href="/wiki/Hell_in_a_Cell" title="Hell in a Cell">Hell in a Cell</a> match in June, 1998 at the <a href="/w/index.php?title=Pittsburgh_Civic_Arena&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Pittsburgh Civic Arena (page does not exist)">Pittsburgh Civic Arena</a>. Before this match, Foley and <a href="/wiki/Terry_Funk" title="Terry Funk">Terry Funk</a> were discussing the previous year's Hell in a Cell (Bad Blood match) that featured the Undertaker backdropping and slamming <a href="/wiki/Shawn_Michaels" title="Shawn Michaels">Shawn Michaels</a> onto the chain-link ceiling of the cage.  Foley and Funk were brainstorming ideas about how to top that match when Funk "said, laughing, 'maybe you should let him throw you off the top of the cage.'"  Foley:

</p><p>In one of the most famous matches in professional wrestling history, Foley received numerous injuries and took two dangerous and highly influential <a href="/wiki/Bump_(professional_wrestling)" title="Bump (professional wrestling)" class="mw-redirect">bumps</a>. The first one came as both wrestlers were brawling on top of the cell, and the Undertaker threw Mankind from the top of the cage from a height of <a href="/w/index.php?title=Template:Convert&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Template:Convert (page does not exist)">Template:Convert</a>; (22&#160;ft if including angle of the fall)<sup id="cite_ref-39" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-39">[39]</a></sup> and sent him crashing through the Spanish announcers' table, which triggered announcer <a href="/wiki/Jim_Ross" title="Jim Ross">Jim Ross</a> to famously shout, "Good God almighty! Good God almighty! That killed him! As God as my witness, he is broken in half!".
</p><p>Foley remained motionless underneath debris, while the Undertaker remained on top of the cell staring down. <a href="/wiki/Terry_Funk" title="Terry Funk">Terry Funk</a> was the first person on the scene, followed by WWE's resident doctor, <a href="/w/index.php?title=Fran%C3%A7ois_Petit&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="François Petit (page does not exist)">Dr. François Petit</a>, and various others, including a concerned-looking <a href="/wiki/Vince_McMahon" title="Vince McMahon">Vince McMahon</a>.  Foley was placed on a stretcher and began to be wheeled out to the arena.
</p><p>Moments later, there was commotion on the entrance ramp as Foley got up from the stretcher
and proceeded to make his way back to the cage, climbing to the top of the cell, with the Undertaker doing likewise (this time they both climbed the cage surprisingly quickly despite Foley having suffered a dislocated shoulder due to the fall, and the Undertaker wrestling with a broken foot that night)<sup id="cite_ref-FoleyDVD_35-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FoleyDVD-35">[35]</a></sup> With both men back on the top of the cell the match resumed.
</p><p>Earlier as both were walking on the chain-link mesh which comprised the cell's ceiling, the metal fasteners were popping off causing the roof to sag and partially give way under their combined weight.  According to Terry Funk, the prop guy had purposely designed it that way, except it was never meant to give way completely.<sup id="cite_ref-40" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-40">[40]</a></sup> In the second huge bump of the night, the Undertaker <a href="/wiki/Chokeslam" title="Chokeslam">chokeslammed</a> Mankind atop the chain-link mesh cage, causing a panel to give way completely, resulting in Foley falling through and hitting the ring canvas hard below.  In response, announcer Jim Ross shouted, "Good God, Good God! Will somebody stop the damn match? Enough's enough!". Color commentator <a href="/wiki/Jerry_Lawler" title="Jerry Lawler">Jerry Lawler</a> then famously retorted, "That's it. He's dead."
</p><p>The cage giving way completely was a surprise to both Foley and the Undertaker<sup id="cite_ref-41" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-41">[41]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-42" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-42">[42]</a></sup> The Undertaker later said that he thought Foley was dead following the second fall.<sup id="cite_ref-43" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-43">[43]</a></sup>  Foley was genuinely knocked unconscious for a few moments from the impact, but was able to come around.  Terry Funk wrote in his autobiography, "Watching from the back, I thought he was dead.  I ran out here and looked down at him, still lying in the ring where he'd landed.  His eyes weren't rolled back in his head, but they looked totally glazed over, like a dead fish's eyes."<sup id="cite_ref-FunkWilliams2006_44-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FunkWilliams2006-44">[44]</a></sup>
</p><p>Some time after getting up and being attended to again by the aforementioned personnel, TV cameras showed a lingering shot of Foley smiling through his profusely bleeding mouth and lips, with a loose tooth hanging beneath his nose; the tooth having been knocked out due to being struck by the chair which had fallen through the cage and landed on his face, dislocating his jaw. In reality, though, Foley was trying to show the camera the hole in his bottom lip by sticking his tongue through it but couldn't be seen because of his facial hair.<sup id="cite_ref-45" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-45">[45]</a></sup>
</p><p>The match continued for a while longer, ending with Foley receiving the Tombstone Piledriver after being slammed by the Undertaker onto hundreds of thumbtacks, which Foley himself had strewn onto the ring canvas. Although Foley lost, both wrestlers received a standing ovation for the match, and the event is often said to have jump-started Foley's main event career (Foley has said that although this match grew in legend, the reality was that his career remained "somewhat sluggish" for sometime afterwards until Foley further developed the Mankind character, and fans began to catch on).<sup id="cite_ref-46" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-46">[46]</a></sup>

In his autobiography <i>Have a Nice Day! A Tale of Blood and Sweatsocks</i>, Foley wrote that he could not remember much of what happened, and he had to watch a tape of the match to write about it. The match was voted <i>Pro Wrestling Illustrated'</i>s Match of the Year for 1998. Although many fans regard the match as a classic, it has generated controversy as well.{{ safesubst:#invoke:Unsubst||$N=Citation needed |date=__DATE__ |$B=

</p><p>Foley said in his first book that his wife cried during a post match phone conversation between the two, and this made Foley strongly consider retiring from wrestling.<sup id="cite_ref-mf663_47-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-mf663-47">[47]</a></sup> He also said that after the match, Vince McMahon thanked him for all he had done for the company, but made Foley promise to "never do anything like that again."<sup id="cite_ref-mf663_47-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-mf663-47">[47]</a></sup> He also made mention in the book of a rather humorous exchange he and Undertaker had while being checked out more thoroughly by Dr. Pettit in the backstage area. Foley, still somewhat dazed from the concussion he sustained, turned to the Undertaker and asked "Did I use the thumbtacks?", which was a staple of a number of Foley's early matches. The Undertaker looked at him and rather sternly replied "Look at your arm, Mick!", at which point Foley discovered a significant number of thumbtacks still lodged in his arm.

Although conventional wisdom holds that the Hell in a Cell match was responsible for Foley's rise to main event status, live television crowds did not initially get behind Mankind because of the match. Following a summer where he teamed with <a href="/w/index.php?title=Glenn_Jacobs&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Glenn Jacobs (page does not exist)">Kane</a> to win the WWF Tag Team Championship on two separate occasions, Foley decided that crowds might respond better if Mankind were more of a comedy character, and so he became less of a tortured soul and more of a goofy, broken down oaf. He began the transition into this character following <i>Summerslam</i> in 1998, after Kane turned on him and the two lost the tag team championships.

<p>The following month Foley began an angle with Vince McMahon, with Mankind trying to be a friend to the hated Mr. McMahon. On the October 5th episode of <i>Raw</i>, while McMahon was in a hospital nursing wounds suffered at the hands of <a href="/wiki/The_Undertaker" title="The Undertaker">The Undertaker</a> and Kane, Mankind arrived to cheer him up. Having succeeded only in irritating McMahon, Mankind unveiled a sock puppet named Mr. Socko. Intended to be a one-time joke, Socko became an overnight sensation. Mankind began putting the sock on his hand before applying his finisher, the <a href="/w/index.php?title=Mandible_claw&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Mandible claw (page does not exist)">mandible claw</a>, stuffing a smelly sock in the mouths of opposing wrestlers. The sweatsock became massively popular with the fans, mainly because it was marketed (mostly by <a href="/wiki/Jerry_Lawler" title="Jerry Lawler">Jerry "The King" Lawler</a> during the events) as being a dirty, smelly, sweaty, repulsive, and vile sock.
</p><p>McMahon manipulated Mankind, who saw the WWF owner as a father figure, into doing his bidding. McMahon created the <a href="/wiki/WWE_Hardcore_Championship" title="WWE Hardcore Championship">Hardcore Championship</a> and awarded it to Mankind, making him the first-ever champion of the hardcore division. Mankind was then pushed as the favorite to win the WWF Championship at <a href="/w/index.php?title=Survivor_Series_(1998)&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Survivor Series (1998) (page does not exist)">Survivor Series</a>, as McMahon appeared to be manipulating the tournament so that Mankind would win. He and <a href="/wiki/Dwayne_Johnson" title="Dwayne Johnson">The Rock</a> both reached the finals, where McMahon turned on Mankind. As The Rock placed Mankind in the <a href="/wiki/Professional_wrestling_holds#Sharpshooter" title="Professional wrestling holds">Sharpshooter</a>, McMahon ordered the timekeeper to ring the bell even though Mankind did not submit, a reference to the <a href="/wiki/Montreal_Screwjob" title="Montreal Screwjob">Montreal Screwjob</a> from the year before. As a result of Survivor Series, Mankind officially transitioned into a fan favorite, while The Rock became a villain and the crown jewel in McMahon's new <a href="/wiki/The_Corporation_(professional_wrestling)" title="The Corporation (professional wrestling)">Corporation</a> faction.
</p><p>After weeks of trying to get his hands on McMahon's new faction, the <a href="/wiki/The_Corporation_(professional_wrestling)" title="The Corporation (professional wrestling)">Corporation</a>, Mankind received a title shot with The Rock at <a href="/w/index.php?title=Rock_Bottom:_In_Your_House&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Rock Bottom: In Your House (page does not exist)">Rock Bottom: In Your House</a>. Mankind knocked The Rock out by shoving a dirty sweatsock in the Rock's mouth, but McMahon ruled that the title would not change hands because The Rock never gave up. After several weeks of going after the Corporation, Mankind had his big night on December 29, where Mankind defeated The Rock and won his first WWF championship. The taped show was broadcast on January 4, 1999, so that is the date WWE recognizes as beginning the title run. Having title changes on broadcast television rather than pay-per-view was uncommon in professional wrestling, but because of the <a href="/w/index.php?title=Monday_Night_Wars&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Monday Night Wars (page does not exist)">Monday Night Wars</a>, TV ratings became more important. The rival WCW, attempting to take advantage of the fact that their show <i>Monday Nitro</i> aired live while Mankind's title victory was taped the week before, had announcer <a href="/wiki/Tony_Schiavone" title="Tony Schiavone">Tony Schiavone</a> reveal the ending of the Mankind-Rock match before it aired. He then added sarcastically, "That'll put a lot of butts in the seats." The move backfired for WCW, as <a href="/wiki/Nielsen_ratings" title="Nielsen ratings">Nielsen ratings</a> showed that Raw won the ratings battle that night, despite the <a href="/w/index.php?title=The_Fingerpoke_of_Doom&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="The Fingerpoke of Doom (page does not exist)">Hogan vs. Nash main event</a> which led to the reformation of the <a href="/w/index.php?title=New_World_Order_(professional_wrestling)&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="New World Order (professional wrestling) (page does not exist)">New World Order</a>. Foley said that the ratings indicate that large numbers of viewers switched from Nitro to Raw to see him win the title and took great personal pride from this, and "Mick Foley put my butt in this seat" signs began showing up at WWF events.
</p><p>Mankind first lost the WWF title to The Rock in an <a href="/wiki/%22I_Quit%22_match" title="&quot;I Quit&quot; match">"I Quit" match</a> at <a href="/w/index.php?title=Royal_Rumble_(1999)&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Royal Rumble (1999) (page does not exist)">Royal Rumble</a>. During the match, Foley took several bumps, including eleven unprotected chair shots. This match is featured on Barry Blaustein's documentary <i><a href="/wiki/Beyond_the_Mat" title="Beyond the Mat">Beyond the Mat</a></i>, which shows the impact the match had on Foley and his family at ringside. The match ended after Mankind lost consciousness and The Rock's allies played a recording of Mankind saying "I Quit" from an earlier interview. The match was also voted 1999's Match of the Year by the readers of <i>Pro Wrestling Illustrated</i>. Mankind won the title back at a rematch on Halftime Heat, which aired during halftime at <a href="/wiki/Super_Bowl_XXXIII" title="Super Bowl XXXIII">Super Bowl XXXIII</a>, in the WWF's first ever <a href="/wiki/Professional_wrestling_match_types#Empty_Arena_match" title="Professional wrestling match types">Empty Arena match</a>.

Mankind was said to have thrown out his left shoulder early in the match, but showed no signs of it and refused to stop the match. It had to be popped back into place afterward. The next night, Mr. McMahon booked a ladder match for the championship, which The Rock won with help from <a href="/w/index.php?title=Paul_Wight&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Paul Wight (page does not exist)">The Big Show</a>. Later in the year, Foley and The Rock patched up their friendship and teamed up to form a comedy team called the <a href="/w/index.php?title=Rock_%27n%27_Sock_Connection&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Rock 'n' Sock Connection (page does not exist)">Rock 'n' Sock Connection</a>, becoming one of the most popular teams during that time. The pair won the tag team titles on three occasions. Foley helped WWF <i>Raw</i> achieve its highest <a href="/wiki/Nielsen_ratings" title="Nielsen ratings">ratings</a> ever with a segment featuring himself (as Mankind) and The Rock. The "This is Your Life" segment aired on September 27, 1999 and received an 8.4 rating.<sup id="cite_ref-49" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-49">[49]</a></sup>

It is believed that Mankind was booked to win the championship that night because Austin refused to lose it to Triple H.<sup id="cite_ref-50" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-50">[50]</a></sup> Foley stated the reason he was booked into the match was because Austin had torn a ligament in his knee and a triple threat match would add enough intangibles to make an acceptable match without aggravating Austin's knee.<sup id="cite_ref-51" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-51">[51]</a></sup> Mankind's win also led to an enraged Triple H to assault Austin, justifying Austin's absence while his knee healed. Triple H defeated Mankind and won the title the next night on <i>Raw</i>. A major feud developed between Mankind and the McMahon-Helmsley regime, led by Triple H, which led to Mankind's reverting to his Cactus Jack persona and facing Triple H for the WWF Championship at <a href="/w/index.php?title=Royal_Rumble_(2000)&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Royal Rumble (2000) (page does not exist)">Royal Rumble</a> in a <a href="/wiki/Hardcore_wrestling" title="Hardcore wrestling">Street Fight</a>. Cactus used barbed wire 2x4 and thumbtacks, trademark weapons from his pre-WWF days, but Triple H won the match after delivering two pedigrees, the second onto a pile of tacks. This feud culminated with a rematch at <a href="/w/index.php?title=No_Way_Out_(2000)&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="No Way Out (2000) (page does not exist)">No Way Out</a> in a Hell in a Cell match, where stipulations held that if Cactus Jack did not win the title, Foley would retire from wrestling.

He also had a knack during this time to have no one spot for his office; rather, Mick would have an office in all sorts of odd places (for example, closets). Foley turned getting <a href="/wiki/Pop_(professional_wrestling)" title="Pop (professional wrestling)" class="mw-redirect">cheap pops</a> into something of a catchphrase, as he shamelessly declared at each WWF show that he was thrilled to be "right here in (whatever city he was performing in (e.g, New York))!" punctuated with an intentionally cheesy thumbs-up gesture. During this time, Commissioner Foley engaged in rivalries with <a href="/wiki/Kurt_Angle" title="Kurt Angle">Kurt Angle</a>, <a href="/wiki/Edge_and_Christian" title="Edge and Christian">Edge and Christian</a>, and Vince McMahon without actually wrestling them.

The two continued to feud, culminating in a <a href="/wiki/Hardcore_wrestling" title="Hardcore wrestling">hardcore match</a> for the <a href="/wiki/WWE_Intercontinental_Championship" title="WWE Intercontinental Championship">WWE Intercontinental Championship</a> at <a href="/w/index.php?title=Backlash_(2004)&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Backlash (2004) (page does not exist)">Backlash</a>, where Orton barely defeated Foley as his Cactus Jack <a href="/wiki/Persona" title="Persona">persona</a> to retain the title with an RKO onto a barbed wire wrapped baseball bat, which Foley now regards as possibly the best match of his career.<sup id="cite_ref-54" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-54">[54]</a></sup>
</p><p>Foley appeared as a color commentator at WWE's <a href="/w/index.php?title=ECW_One_Night_Stand_(2005)&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="ECW One Night Stand (2005) (page does not exist)">ECW One Night Stand</a>, which aired on June 12, 2005, and subsequently renewed his contract with WWE. Foley returned in 2005 in a match where fans were able to vote on which persona he would appear as—Mankind, Dude Love, or Cactus Jack—against <a href="/w/index.php?title=Carly_Col%C3%B3n&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Carly Colón (page does not exist)">Carlito</a> at <a href="/w/index.php?title=Taboo_Tuesday_(2005)&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Taboo Tuesday (2005) (page does not exist)">Taboo Tuesday</a>. Foley cut promos for each character and an online vote was held. The fans voted for Mankind, who went on to win the match. On the February 16, 2006 <i>Raw</i>, Foley returned to referee the WWE Championship match between <a href="/w/index.php?title=Adam_Copeland&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Adam Copeland (page does not exist)">Edge</a> and <a href="/wiki/John_Cena" title="John Cena">John Cena</a>. After Cena won, Edge attacked Foley, and the following week, Edge challenged Foley to a match at <a href="/wiki/WrestleMania_22" title="WrestleMania 22">WrestleMania 22</a>. Edge defeated Foley after spearing him through a flaming table. In the weeks after the match, Foley turned heel and allied himself with Edge against the newly rejuvenated <a href="/w/index.php?title=ECW_on_Sci_Fi&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="ECW on Sci Fi (page does not exist)">ECW</a>. This was the first WWE heel turn (and his final heel turn) of Foley since his feud with Stone Cold Steve Austin as Dude Love in 1998. This was also his first heel run under his real name. Also during that time he changed his "thrilled to be here" catch phrase into a more heelish type way. For example on a RAW episode in Las Vegas Foley would say, "I'm thrilled to be right here in Las Vegas!" Then right after that he would say, "Well actually, Las Vegas isn't all that great." Then he would continue to make more negative comments while fans start booing at him. At <a href="/w/index.php?title=ECW_One_Night_Stand_(2006)&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="ECW One Night Stand (2006) (page does not exist)">ECW One Night Stand</a>, Foley, Edge and <a href="/w/index.php?title=Amy_Dumas&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Amy Dumas (page does not exist)">Lita</a> defeated Terry Funk, <a href="/wiki/Tommy_Dreamer" title="Tommy Dreamer">Tommy Dreamer</a> and <a href="/w/index.php?title=Trisa_Hayes&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Trisa Hayes (page does not exist)">Beulah McGillicutty</a>.
</p><p>Foley then engaged in a storyline rivalry with Ric Flair, inspired by real-life animosity between the two. In <i>Have a Nice Day!</i>, Foley wrote that Flair was "every bit as bad on the booking side of things as he was great on the wrestling side of it." In response, Flair wrote in his autobiography that Foley was "a glorified stuntman" and that he was able to climb the ladder in the WWF only because he was friends with the bookers. The two had a backstage confrontation at a <i>Raw</i> event in 2003, but Foley has said that they have largely reconciled.<sup id="cite_ref-SlamFoleyRicFlair_55-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-SlamFoleyRicFlair-55">[55]</a></sup> To spark the feud, Flair again called Foley a "glorified <a href="/wiki/Stunt_performer" title="Stunt performer">stuntman</a>" and Foley called Flair a "washed up piece of crap" and challenged him to a match. The result was a Two out of Three Falls match at <a href="/w/index.php?title=Vengeance_(2006)&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Vengeance (2006) (page does not exist)">Vengeance</a>, where Flair beat Foley in two straight falls; with a rollup counter to the figure four in the first and by disqualification in the second after a trashcan shot. After the match, Flair was split wide open by Foley with a barbed wire bat. The two then wrestled an <a href="/wiki/%22I_Quit%22_match" title="&quot;I Quit&quot; match">"I Quit" match</a> at <a href="/w/index.php?title=SummerSlam_(2006)&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="SummerSlam (2006) (page does not exist)">SummerSlam</a>, which Flair won when he forced Foley to quit by threatening <a href="/wiki/Melina_Perez" title="Melina Perez">Melina</a> with a barbed wire bat.<sup id="cite_ref-56" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-56">[56]</a></sup> On the August 21 edition of <i>Raw</i>, Foley literally kissed <a href="/wiki/Vince_McMahon" title="Vince McMahon">Vince McMahon</a>'s <a href="/w/index.php?title=Buttocks&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Buttocks (page does not exist)">buttocks</a> as part of McMahon's "<a href="/wiki/Vince_McMahon#Kiss_My_Ass_Club_Members" title="Vince McMahon">Kiss My Ass Club</a>" gimmick after he threatened to fire Melina. Shortly thereafter, she betrayed Foley and announced that he was fired.
</p><p>Seven months later, Foley made his return to <i>Raw</i> on March 5, 2007 as a face again and tricked McMahon into giving him his job back. On April 9, Foley contributed to the <a href="/w/index.php?title=Make-a-Wish_Foundation&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Make-a-Wish Foundation (page does not exist)">Make-a-Wish Foundation</a> and helped a young child named Michael Peña to become an honorary <a href="/w/index.php?title=Professional_wrestling_authority_figures&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Professional wrestling authority figures (page does not exist)">General Manager</a> of the night.<sup id="cite_ref-wrestlecast_57-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-wrestlecast-57">[57]</a></sup> Foley appeared again on June 11 for Mr. McMahon Appreciation Night insulting McMahon. Foley also announced his place as a number one contender for the WWE Championship. During the <i>Raw</i> broadcast before <a href="/w/index.php?title=Vengeance:_Night_of_Champions&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Vengeance: Night of Champions (page does not exist)">Vengeance</a>, Foley was scheduled to make his official in-ring return in a match against Umaga but he attacked Umaga before the match, and the match was never started. At Vengeance, Foley wrestled in a WWE Championship Challenge match involving WWE Champion John Cena, <a href="/wiki/Randy_Orton" title="Randy Orton">Randy Orton</a>, <a href="/w/index.php?title=Booker_Huffman&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Booker Huffman (page does not exist)">King Booker</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Bobby_Lashley" title="Bobby Lashley">Bobby Lashley</a>.

Hornswoggle won the match, after Foley handed him a miniature Mr. Socko. Foley then made an appearance on <i>SmackDown</i> the same week, where he defeated Coachman with Hornswoggle as the special guest referee. On the January 7, 2008 episode of <i>Raw</i>, Foley and his tag team partner Hornswoggle qualified for the <a href="/w/index.php?title=Royal_Rumble_(2008)&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Royal Rumble (2008) (page does not exist)">Royal Rumble</a> by defeating <a href="/w/index.php?title=The_Highlanders_(professional_wrestling)&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="The Highlanders (professional wrestling) (page does not exist)">The Highlanders</a>, but Foley was eliminated by Triple H during the Rumble.

Foley told Long Island Press pro wrestling columnist Josh Stewart in August 2008 that "creatively, the announcing job wasn't working out too well". Foley allowed his contract with WWE to expire on September 1, 2008 and quietly left the company.

After his initial appearance with ROH, Foley refereed a match between Jerry Lawler and <a href="/wiki/Slyck_Wagner_Brown" title="Slyck Wagner Brown">Slyck Wagner Brown</a> for the New England Wrestling promotion on October 3. On October 15, Foley returned to ROH where he confronted <a href="/wiki/Ricky_Steamboat" title="Ricky Steamboat">Ricky Steamboat</a>, who claimed that traditional wrestling was better than hardcore wrestling. The next day, both Foley and Steamboat cut promos on each other, leading to a match between Team Steamboat (<a href="/w/index.php?title=Nigel_McGuiness&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Nigel McGuiness (page does not exist)">Nigel McGuiness</a> and <a href="/wiki/Chad_Collyer" title="Chad Collyer">Chad Collyer</a>) and Team Foley (<a href="/w/index.php?title=Dan_Lopez&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Dan Lopez (page does not exist)">Dan Maff</a> and <a href="/w/index.php?title=BJ_Whitmer&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="BJ Whitmer (page does not exist)">BJ Whitmer</a>) later in the night, which Team Steamboat won.

</p><p>Foley returned to ROH on December 26 at ROH's Final Battle event and had his final confrontation with Ricky Steamboat (who had been rehired with WWE as a road agent), and the two made peace. On January 15, 2005, Foley turned heel after he was confronted by Samoa Joe and hit Joe over the head with a steel chair. One week later, Foley appeared with <a href="/w/index.php?title=Border_City_Wrestling&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Border City Wrestling (page does not exist)">Border City Wrestling</a> to referee the match between <a href="/wiki/Alex_Shelley" title="Alex Shelley">Alex Shelley</a> and <a href="/wiki/Chris_Sabin" title="Chris Sabin">Chris Sabin</a> for the BCW Television Championship, which Sabin won.

But then, out came <a href="/w/index.php?title=Scott_Levy&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Scott Levy (page does not exist)">Raven</a>, who cut a promo saying that he had only ever been the one true star of ECW and everyone else had just been a <a href="/wiki/Job_(professional_wrestling)" title="Job (professional wrestling)">jobber</a>, leading to a match between Raven and Balls Mahoney later in the night, which Raven won by DQ when he threw fire in Mahoney's eyes. After this, Foley and several of the other ECW alumni came to the ring and attacked Raven.
</p><p>On April 2, Foley appeared with <a href="/wiki/Harley_Race" title="Harley Race">Harley Race</a>'s <a href="/w/index.php?title=World_League_Wrestling&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="World League Wrestling (page does not exist)">World League Wrestling</a> to referee a match between <a href="/w/index.php?title=William_Mueller&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="William Mueller (page does not exist)">Trevor Rhodes</a> and Brandon Bishop, which was ruled a No-Contest.

Foley and Douglas won the match.
</p><p>The main event of the ECW reunion show Hardcore Homecoming was Terry Funk versus Sabu versus Shane Douglas in a Triple Threat Elimination No Ropes Barbed Wire Match. During the middle of the match, <a href="/wiki/Bill_Alfonso" title="Bill Alfonso">Bill Alfonso</a>, who was in Sabu's corner, began pulling Shane Douglas into the wire, which led to <a href="/wiki/Francine_Fournier" title="Francine Fournier">Francine</a> who was in Douglas' corner, attacking Alfonso. Using this as a distraction, Douglas brought a ladder into the ring when suddenly the lights in the arena went out. When they came back on, Foley was in the ring, as Cactus Jack, wearing a referee shirt. Foley pulled out a barbed-wire wrapped Mr. Socko and applied the Mandible Claw on Douglas, then DDT'd Douglas onto a steel chair. Terry Funk then crawled onto Douglas and eliminated him when Foley made the 3-count. After that, Funk targeted Sabu, throwing him into the barbed wire, then setting up a table and putting Sabu on it. Funk then climbed up the ladder, but before he got far, it collapsed from under his weight, sending him crashing through the table. Sabu then recovered, gave Funk an Arabian Facebuster off a chair, and pinned Funk to win the match. After the match ended, all four of them were greeted with chants of "Terry!" and "Sabu!" and "Foley!" and "Thank You Shane!" and of course "E-C-Dub! E-C-Dub!". The entire locker room emptied moments later and celebrated with Funk, Sabu, Foley, and Douglas in the ring to continued "E-C-Dub" chants.
</p><p>On July 8, Foley returned to ROH as a face, confronting ROH Champion CM Punk, who had turned heel and mocked ROH and the championship after he had signed with WWE and threatened to take the title with him to WWE. Foley acted as a direct line to Vince McMahon, attempting to convince Punk to defend his title one last time on McMahon's orders before he departed from ROH (which he eventually would.)
</p><p>On August 13, Foley made an appearance with Ballpark Brawl to make fun of <a href="/wiki/Matt_Striker" title="Matt Striker">Matt Striker</a>, who had been doing an impersonation of The Rock. Later in the event, Foley refereed the Canes, Tables, and Chairs match between Sandman and Sabu, which Sandman won. After the match, Foley celebrated with Sandman by drinking beer with him in the middle of the ring.
</p><p>On August 20, Foley returned to ROH again, as a face, to rescue <a href="/w/index.php?title=Jade_Chung&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Jade Chung (page does not exist)">Jade Chung</a> from <a href="/w/index.php?title=Prince_Nana&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Prince Nana (page does not exist)">Prince Nana</a>.

One week later, Foley returned to the ring for the second WrestleReunion show to team with Terry Funk and Dory Funk, Jr in a losing effort against the <a href="/wiki/The_Midnight_Express_(professional_wrestling)" title="The Midnight Express (professional wrestling)">Midnight Express</a> (<a href="/wiki/Stan_Lane" title="Stan Lane">Stan Lane</a>, <a href="/wiki/Bobby_Eaton" title="Bobby Eaton">Bobby Eaton</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Dennis_Condrey" title="Dennis Condrey">Dennis Condrey</a>.)
</p><p>Foley made his final regular appearance with ROH on September 17, when he was in <a href="/wiki/A.J._Styles" title="A.J. Styles">A.J. Styles</a>' corner in a match against Embassy member <a href="/w/index.php?title=Jimmy_Rave&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Jimmy Rave (page does not exist)">Jimmy Rave</a>, which Styles won. Afterwards, Foley put over ROH huge saying he enjoyed being on ROH shows and would speak highly of it.
</p><p>Foley made his final major independent circuit appearance on the Tribute to <i>Starrcade</i> show on November 19 as the referee for the match between Dustin Rhodes and Terry Funk, which ended in a No-Contest.

<p>Much of Foley's charitable work revolves around children.

</p><p>Foley has visited U.S. troops at various military bases and military hospitals. For several years Foley visited wounded soldiers at Washington D.C.-based military hospitals on almost a monthly basis, becoming known as a "Legend among hurt troops," according to a <i>Washington Times</i> article.<sup id="cite_ref-117" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-117">[117]</a></sup>

During a 15-month period ending in April 2011, Foley logged more than 550 hours talking to victims online. The same month, Foley offered to mow anyone's lawn who donated up to a certain amount to the organization, stating, "If you want to help survivors of sexual assault, or just want to see a big guy with long hair mowing your lawn in front of your friends, please take part..."<sup id="cite_ref-118" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-118">[118]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-119" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-119">[119]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-120" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-120">[120]</a></sup>
