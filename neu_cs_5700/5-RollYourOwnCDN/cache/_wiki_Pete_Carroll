</p><p>Carroll's fourth season, 2013, was his greatest level of success in the professional league. His Seahawks finished the regular season with a sterling 13-3 record, placing them on top of the NFC conference for their first time since 2005. The '05 Seahawks produced an identical record, excelled through the playoffs, and into the Super Bowl for the first time in franchise history. The previous year, even explicitly marked with a divisional round loss, confirmed to the league that they were viable contenders. Carroll's improvements had finally become conspicuous; and Seattle believed, righteously, that their agonizing two-point loss to the Falcons would be avenged.
</p><p>The Seattle Seahawks 2013 season began with four consecutive preseason wins, and had been distinguished, by oddsmakers, as the conference favorite. The regular season began with a victory at Carolina. The second game, and first played at home, confirmed any doubts about them being a genuine Super Bowl contender. The prior year's NFC Champions, and divisional rival, the San Francisco 49ers, were blown-out by the Seahawks 29-3. Winning out September, they visited the Colts in Indianapolis, and suffered their first loss, on October 6. That was the only loss Carroll, and team, would suffer until December. Heading to San Francisco for their second matchup against divisional foe, the Seahawks were consensus best in NFC, posting an 11-1 record. However, the game was in stark contrast to their first in September. The 49ers edged out a 19-17 win, yet the Seahawk's now 11-2 record was still best in the conference. The penultimate game against the Arizona Cardinals, was Seattle's attempt to continue their at-home winning streak to an incredible 15 games (record started in Week 2 of 2012 season). Although the Seahawks had won their three prior meetings, including one earlier in the year, the Cardinals had steadily improved during the season. The at-home win streak did not reach 15. The Cardinals won, and Seattle suffered its third loss of the year. However, that loss on December 22, 2013, would be Carroll and team's most recent loss to date. Their regular season finale, against the St. Louis Rams, established a new at-home streak of one, and Carroll concluded the regular season at 13-3. The number one team (and playoff seed) in the NFC, Carroll matched Mike Holmgren's 2005 season of the same record, tying for the best in Seattle history.

<p>On offense, Carroll is known for using aggressive play-calling that is open to trick plays as well as "going for it" on 4th down instead of punting the ball away.<sup id="cite_ref-ESPN080907_75-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-ESPN080907-75">[74]</a></sup> Because of his aggressive style, the USC Band gave him the nickname "Big Balls Pete". At USC  home games, when Pete Carroll decided to go for it on 4th down, the USC band would start a chant of "Big Balls Pete" that carried over to the students section and the alumni.<sup id="cite_ref-Esq09_6-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Esq09-6">[6]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-LAT082607a_76-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-LAT082607a-76">[75]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-LAT102207_77-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-LAT102207-77">[76]</a></sup>
</p><p>On defense, Carroll favors a bend-but-don't-break scheme of preventing the big plays: allowing opposing teams to get small yardage but trying to keep the plays in front of his defenders.<sup id="cite_ref-LAT092207_78-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-LAT092207-78">[77]</a></sup>
</p><p>Carroll draws coaching inspiration from the 1974 book <i>The Inner Game of Tennis</i>, by tennis coach <a href="/w/index.php?title=W._Timothy_Gallwey&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="W.

Jerry Garcia said that he didn't want his band to be the best ones doing something. He wanted them to be the only ones doing it. To be all by yourself out there doing something that nobody else can touch — that's the thought that guides me, that guides this program: We're going to do things better than it's ever been done before in everything we do, and we're going to compete our ass off.
