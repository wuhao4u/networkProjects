<p>Harriet Tubman was born Araminta "Minty" Ross to slave parents, Harriet ("Rit") Green and Ben Ross. Rit was owned by Mary Pattison Brodess (and later her son Edward).  Ben was held by Anthony Thompson, who became Mary's second husband, and who ran a large <a href="/wiki/Plantation" title="Plantation">plantation</a> near <a href="/w/index.php?title=Blackwater_River_(Maryland)&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Blackwater River (Maryland) (page does not exist)">Blackwater River</a> in <a href="/w/index.php?title=Madison,_Maryland&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Madison, Maryland (page does not exist)">Madison, Maryland</a>. As with many slaves in the United States, neither the exact year nor place of Araminta's birth was recorded, and historians differ as to the best estimate. <a href="/w/index.php?title=Kate_Larson&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Kate Larson (page does not exist)">Kate Larson</a> records the year 1822, based on a midwife payment and several other historical documents, including her runaway advertisement<sup id="cite_ref-Larson.2C_p._16_3-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Larson.2C_p._16-3">[3]</a></sup> while Jean Humez says "the best current evidence suggests that Tubman was born in 1820, but it might have been a year or two later."<sup id="cite_ref-Humez_4-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Humez-4">[4]</a></sup> <a href="/w/index.php?title=Catherine_Clinton&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Catherine Clinton (page does not exist)">Catherine Clinton</a> notes that Tubman reported the year of her birth as 1825, while her death certificate lists 1815 and her gravestone lists 1820.<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup> In her Civil War <a href="/w/index.php?title=Widow%27s_pension&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Widow's pension (page does not exist)">widow's pension</a> records, Tubman claimed she was born in 1820, 1822, and 1825, an indication, perhaps, that she had only a general idea of when she was born.

</p><p>Rit struggled to keep their family together as slavery threatened to tear it apart.

</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Childhood">Childhood</span></h2>
<p>Because Tubman's mother was assigned to "the big house" and had scarce time for her family, as a child Tubman took care of a younger brother and a baby, as was typical in large families.<sup id="cite_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-15">[15]</a></sup> When she was five or six years old, Brodess hired her out as a nursemaid to a woman named "Miss Susan." Tubman was ordered to keep watch on the baby as it slept; when it woke and cried, Tubman was whipped. She later recounted a particular day when she was lashed five times before breakfast. She carried the scars for the rest of her life.<sup id="cite_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-16">[16]</a></sup> She found ways to resist, running away for five days,<sup id="cite_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-17">[17]</a></sup> wearing layers of clothing as protection against beatings, and fighting back.<sup id="cite_ref-Cli19_18-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Cli19-18">[18]</a></sup>
</p><p>As a child, Tubman also worked at the home of a <a href="/w/index.php?title=Planter_(plantation_owner)&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Planter (plantation owner) (page does not exist)">planter</a> named James Cook.  She had to check the <a href="/wiki/Muskrat" title="Muskrat">muskrat</a> traps in nearby marshes, even after contracting <a href="/wiki/Measles" title="Measles">measles</a>.  She became so ill that Cook sent her back to Brodess, where her mother nursed her back to health.  Brodess then hired her out again. Tubman spoke later of her acute childhood <a href="/wiki/Homesickness" title="Homesickness">homesickness</a>, comparing herself to "the boy on the <a href="/wiki/Suwannee_River" title="Suwannee River">Swanee River</a>," an allusion to <a href="/wiki/Stephen_Foster" title="Stephen Foster">Stephen Foster's</a> song "<a href="/wiki/Old_Folks_at_Home" title="Old Folks at Home">Old Folks at Home</a>."<sup id="cite_ref-Lar38_19-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Lar38-19">[19]</a></sup> As she grew older and stronger, she was assigned to field and forest work, driving oxen, plowing, and hauling logs.<sup id="cite_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-20">[20]</a></sup>
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Head_injury">Head injury</span></h3>
<p>One day, the adolescent Tubman was sent to a dry-goods store for supplies. There, she encountered a slave owned by another family, who had left the fields without permission. His overseer, furious, demanded that Tubman help restrain the young man. She refused, and as the slave ran away, the overseer threw a two-pound weight at him. He struck Tubman instead, which she said "broke my skull." She later explained her belief that her hair – which "had never been combed and&#160;...&#160;stood out like a bushel basket" – might have saved her life. Bleeding and unconscious, Tubman was returned to her owner's house and laid on the seat of a loom, where she remained without medical care for two days. She was sent back into the fields, "with blood and sweat rolling down my face until I couldn't see."<sup id="cite_ref-Lar42_21-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Lar42-21">[21]</a></sup> Her boss said she was "not worth a sixpence" and returned her to Brodess, who tried unsuccessfully to sell her.<sup id="cite_ref-Cli22_22-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Cli22-22">[22]</a></sup> She began having seizures and would seemingly fall unconscious, although she claimed to be aware of her surroundings while appearing to be asleep. These episodes were alarming to her family, who were unable to wake her when she fell asleep suddenly and without warning. This condition remained with Tubman for the rest of her life; Larson suggests she may have suffered from <a href="/w/index.php?title=Temporal_lobe_epilepsy&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Temporal lobe epilepsy (page does not exist)">temporal lobe epilepsy</a> as a result of the injury.<sup id="cite_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-23">[23]</a></sup>
</p><p>The severe head wound occurred when Tubman was becoming deeply religious--although one must note this is not insinuating this as being the chief cause.

She rejected the teachings of the <a href="/wiki/New_Testament" title="New Testament">New Testament</a> that urged slaves to be obedient and found guidance in the <a href="/wiki/Old_Testament" title="Old Testament">Old Testament</a> tales of deliverance.

<p>By 1840, Tubman's father, Ben, was <a href="/w/index.php?title=Manumitted&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Manumitted (page does not exist)">manumitted</a> from slavery at the age of 45, as stipulated in a former owner's <a href="/w/index.php?title=Will_(law)&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Will (law) (page does not exist)">will</a>, though his real age was closer to 55. He continued working as a timber estimator and foreman for the Thompson family, who had held him as a slave.<sup id="cite_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-26">[26]</a></sup> Several years later, Tubman contacted a white attorney and paid him five dollars to investigate her mother's legal status. The lawyer discovered that a former owner had issued instructions that Rit, like her husband, would be manumitted at the age of 45. The record showed that a similar provision would apply to Rit's children, and that any children born after she reached 45 years of age were legally free, but the Pattison and Brodess families had ignored this stipulation when they inherited the slaves.  Challenging it legally was an impossible task for Tubman.<sup id="cite_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-27">[27]</a></sup>
</p><p>Around 1844, she married a free black man named John Tubman.<sup id="cite_ref-Lar62_28-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Lar62-28">[28]</a></sup> Although little is known about him or their time together, the union was complicated because of her slave status. Since <a href="/w/index.php?title=Partus_sequitur_ventrum&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Partus sequitur ventrum (page does not exist)">the mother's status</a> dictated that of children, any children born to Harriet and John would be enslaved. Such blended marriages - free people marrying enslaved people – were not uncommon on the Eastern Shore of Maryland, where by this time, half the black population was free. Most African-American families had both free and enslaved members. Larson suggests that they might have planned to buy Tubman's freedom.<sup id="cite_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-29">[29]</a></sup>
</p><p>Tubman changed her name from Araminta to Harriet soon after her marriage, though the exact timing is unclear.

<p>Tubman and her brothers, Ben and Henry, escaped from slavery on September 17, 1849. Tubman had been hired out to Dr. Anthony Thompson, who owned a large plantation in an area called Poplar Neck in neighboring Caroline County; it is likely her brothers labored for Thompson as well. Because the slaves were hired out to another household, Eliza Brodess probably did not recognize their absence as an escape attempt for some time. Two weeks later, she posted a runaway notice in the <a href="/wiki/Cambridge,_Maryland" title="Cambridge, Maryland">Cambridge</a> <i>Democrat</i>, offering a reward of up to 100 dollars for each slave returned.<sup id="cite_ref-39" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-39">[39]</a></sup> Once they had left, Tubman's brothers had second thoughts.

</p><p>Soon afterward, Tubman escaped again, this time without her brothers.<sup id="cite_ref-Lar80_41-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Lar80-41">[41]</a></sup> Beforehand, she tried to send word to her mother of her plans.

This informal, but well-organized, system was composed of free and enslaved blacks, white abolitionists, and other activists. Most prominent among the latter in Maryland at the time were members of the <a href="/w/index.php?title=Religious_Society_of_Friends&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Religious Society of Friends (page does not exist)">Religious Society of Friends</a>, often called Quakers.<sup id="cite_ref-Lar80_41-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Lar80-41">[41]</a></sup> The Preston area near Poplar Neck in Caroline County contained a substantial Quaker community, and was probably an important first stop during Tubman's escape.<sup id="cite_ref-43" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-43">[43]</a></sup> From there, she probably took a common route for fleeing slaves - northeast along the <a href="/wiki/Choptank_River" title="Choptank River">Choptank River</a>, through <a href="/wiki/Delaware" title="Delaware">Delaware</a> and then north into <a href="/wiki/Pennsylvania" title="Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-Cli37_44-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Cli37-44">[44]</a></sup> A journey of nearly 90 miles (145 kilometers), her traveling by foot would have taken between five days and three weeks.<sup id="cite_ref-45" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-45">[45]</a></sup>

When night fell, the family hid her in a cart and took her to the next friendly house.<sup id="cite_ref-47" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-47">[47]</a></sup> Given her familiarity with the woods and marshes of the region, Tubman during the day likely hid in these locales.<sup id="cite_ref-Cli37_44-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Cli37-44">[44]</a></sup> Tubman only later described her routes because other fugitive slaves used them.
</p><p>Particulars of her first journey remain shrouded in secrecy.<sup id="cite_ref-48" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-48">[48]</a></sup> She crossed into Pennsylvania with a feeling of relief and awe, and recalled the experience years later: 
</p>

She stayed with Sam Green, a free black minister living in East New Market, Maryland; she also hid near her parents' home at Poplar Neck in Caroline County, Maryland. She  would travel from there northeast to Sandtown and Willow Grove, Delaware, and to the Camden area where free black agents, William and Nat Brinkley and Abraham Gibbs, guided her north past Dover, Smyrna, and Blackbird, where other agents would take her across the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal to New Castle and Wilmington.

<p>Because the Fugitive Slave Law had made the northern United States more dangerous for escaped slaves, many began migrating to Southern Ontario.

Her journeys into the land of slavery put her at tremendous risk, and she used a variety of subterfuges to avoid detection. Tubman once disguised herself with a <a href="/wiki/Bonnet_(headgear)" title="Bonnet (headgear)">bonnet</a> and carried two live <a href="/wiki/Chickens" title="Chickens" class="mw-redirect">chickens</a> to give the appearance of running errands.

Since Tubman was known to be illiterate, the man ignored her.<sup id="cite_ref-67" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-67">[67]</a></sup>
</p><p>Her religious faith was another important resource as she ventured repeatedly into Maryland. The visions from her childhood head injury continued, and she saw them as divine <a href="/w/index.php?title=Premonitions&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Premonitions (page does not exist)">premonitions</a>. She spoke of "consulting with God," and trusted that He would keep her safe.<sup id="cite_ref-Cli91_68-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Cli91-68">[68]</a></sup> Thomas Garrett once said of her, "I never met with any person of any color who had more confidence in the voice of God, as spoken direct to her soul."<sup id="cite_ref-69" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-69">[69]</a></sup> Her faith in the divine also provided immediate assistance.

</p><p>She carried a <a href="/wiki/Revolver" title="Revolver">revolver</a>, and was not afraid to use it. Once a slave agreed to join her expedition, there was no turning back; she threatened to shoot anyone who tried to return.<sup id="cite_ref-71" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-71">[71]</a></sup> Tubman told the tale of one journey with a group of fugitive slaves, when morale sank and one man insisted he was going to go back to the plantation. She pointed the gun at his head and said, "You go on or die."<sup id="cite_ref-72" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-72">[72]</a></sup> Several days later, he was with the group as they entered the United Province of Canada.<sup id="cite_ref-Cli91_68-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Cli91-68">[68]</a></sup> It is more than likely that Tubman carried the handgun as protection from ever-present slave catchers and their dogs.
</p><p>Slaveholders in the region, meanwhile, never knew that "Minty," the petite, five-foot-tall, disabled slave who had run away years before and never come back, was behind so many slave escapes in their community. By the late 1850s, they began to suspect a northern white abolitionist was secretly enticing their slaves away. They considered that <a href="/wiki/John_Brown_(abolitionist)" title="John Brown (abolitionist)">John Brown</a> himself had come to the Eastern Shore to lure slaves away before his ill-fated raid on <a href="/wiki/Harper%27s_Ferry" title="Harper's Ferry" class="mw-redirect">Harper's Ferry</a> in October 1859.
</p><p>While a popular legend persists about a reward of US$40,000 for Tubman's capture, this is a manufactured figure. In 1868, in an effort to drum up support for Tubman's claim for a Civil War military pension, a former abolitionist named Salley Holley wrote an article claiming US$40,000 "was not too great a reward for Maryland slaveholders to offer for her."<sup id="cite_ref-73" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-73">[73]</a></sup> Such a high reward would have garnered national attention, especially at a time when a small farm could be purchased for a mere US$400. No such reward has been found in period newspapers. (The federal government offered $25,000 for the capture of each of <a href="/wiki/John_Wilkes_Booth" title="John Wilkes Booth">John Wilkes Booth</a>'s co-conspirators in Lincoln's assassination.) A reward offering of US$12,000 has also been claimed, though no documentation exists for that figure either. Catherine Clinton suggests that the US$40,000 figure may have been a combined total of the various <a href="/wiki/Bounty_(reward)" title="Bounty (reward)">bounties</a> offered around the region.<sup id="cite_ref-Cli131_74-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Cli131-74">[74]</a></sup>
</p><p>Despite the best efforts of the slaveholders, Tubman was never captured, and neither were the fugitives she guided. Years later, she told an audience: "I was conductor of the Underground Railroad for eight years, and I can say what most conductors can't say – I never ran my train off the track and I never lost a passenger."<sup id="cite_ref-75" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-75">[75]</a></sup> One of her last missions into Maryland was to retrieve her aging parents. Her father, Ben, had purchased Rit, her mother, in 1855 from Eliza Brodess for 20 dollars.<sup id="cite_ref-76" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-76">[76]</a></sup> But even when they were both free, the area became hostile to their presence. Two years later, Tubman received word that her father had harbored a group of eight escaped slaves, and was at risk of arrest. She traveled to the Eastern Shore and led them north to St. Catharines, Ontario, where a community of former slaves (including Tubman's brothers, other relatives, and many friends) had gathered.<sup id="cite_ref-77" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-77">[77]</a></sup>

<p>Thus, as he began recruiting supporters for an attack on slaveholders, Brown was joined by "General Tubman," as he called her.<sup id="cite_ref-Cli129_78-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Cli129-78">[78]</a></sup> Her knowledge of support networks and resources in the border states of Pennsylvania, Maryland and Delaware was invaluable to Brown and his planners. Although other abolitionists like Frederick Douglass and <a href="/wiki/William_Lloyd_Garrison" title="William Lloyd Garrison">William Lloyd Garrison</a> did not endorse his tactics, Brown dreamed of fighting to create a new state for freed slaves, and made preparations for military action. After he began the first battle, he believed, slaves would rise up and carry out a rebellion across the south.<sup id="cite_ref-80" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-80">[80]</a></sup> He asked Tubman to gather former slaves then living in present-day Southern Ontario who might be willing to join his fighting force, which she did.<sup id="cite_ref-81" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-81">[81]</a></sup>
</p><p>On May 8, 1858, Brown held a meeting in <a href="/w/index.php?title=Chatham-Kent,_Ontario&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Chatham-Kent, Ontario (page does not exist)">Chatham-Kent, Ontario</a>, where he unveiled his plan for a raid on <a href="/wiki/Harpers_Ferry,_West_Virginia" title="Harpers Ferry, West Virginia">Harpers Ferry, Virginia</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-82" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-82">[82]</a></sup> When word of the plan was leaked to the government, Brown put the scheme on hold and began raising funds for its eventual resumption. Tubman aided him in this effort, and with more detailed plans for the assault.<sup id="cite_ref-83" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-83">[83]</a></sup>
</p><p>Tubman was busy during this time, giving talks to abolitionist audiences and tending to her relatives.

</p><p>The raid failed; Brown was convicted of <a href="/wiki/Treason" title="Treason">treason</a> and hanged in December. His actions were seen by abolitionists as a symbol of proud resistance, carried out by a noble martyr.<sup id="cite_ref-87" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-87">[87]</a></sup> Tubman herself was effusive with praise.

</p><p>In November 1860, Tubman conducted her last rescue mission. Throughout the 1850s, Tubman had been unable to effect the escape of her  sister, Rachel, and Rachel's two children, Ben and Angerine. Upon returning to Dorchester County, Tubman discovered that Rachel had died, and the children could only be rescued if she could pay a US$30 bribe. She had no money, so the children remained enslaved. Their fates remain unknown. Never one to waste a trip, Tubman gathered another group, including the Ennals family, ready and willing to take the risks of the journey north. It took them weeks to safely get away because of slave catchers, forcing them to hide out longer than expected. The weather was unseasonably cold and they had little food. The children were drugged with <a href="/wiki/Paregoric" title="Paregoric">paregoric</a> to keep them quiet while slave patrols rode by.

<p>Harriet Tubman, widely known and well-respected while she was alive, became an American icon in the years after she died.
