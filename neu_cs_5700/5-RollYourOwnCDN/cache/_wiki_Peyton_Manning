From 1998 to 2010, he led the Colts to eight (seven <a href="/w/index.php?title=American_Football_Conference_South_Division&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="American Football Conference South Division (page does not exist)">AFC South</a> and one <a href="/w/index.php?title=American_Football_Conference_South_Division&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="American Football Conference South Division (page does not exist)">AFC East</a>) division championships, two AFC championships, and one <a href="/wiki/Super_Bowl" title="Super Bowl">Super Bowl</a> championship (<a href="/wiki/Super_Bowl_XLI" title="Super Bowl XLI">Super Bowl XLI</a>).

</p><p>In May 2011, he underwent neck surgery to alleviate neck pain and arm weakness he dealt with during the previous few seasons before signing a five-year, $90 million contract extension with the Colts in July 2011. Manning had hoped to play in the 2011 season, but in September 2011 he underwent a second, and much more serious surgery: a level one <a href="/w/index.php?title=Spinal_fusion&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Spinal fusion (page does not exist)">cervical fusion</a> procedure. Manning had never missed an NFL game in his career, but was forced to miss the entire 2011 season. He was released by the Colts on March 7, 2012, and after an almost two-week period where he visited with and worked out for several NFL teams, he signed with the Denver Broncos on March 20, 2012.
</p><p>Manning's pre-snap routine has earned him the nickname "The Sheriff",<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup> and he is one of the most recognizable and parodied players in the NFL.<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup> Teams led by Manning more often than not use the <a href="/wiki/Hurry-up_offense" title="Hurry-up offense">hurry-up offense</a> in place of the standard <a href="/w/index.php?title=Huddle&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Huddle (page does not exist)">huddle</a>.
