At least 20 films and television dramas have been produced of Capote novels, stories and plays.
</p><p>Capote rose above a childhood troubled by divorce, a long absence from his mother, and multiple migrations. He had discovered his calling as a writer by the age of 11, and for the rest of his childhood he honed his writing ability. Capote began his professional career writing short stories. The critical success of one story, "<a href="/w/index.php?title=Miriam_(short_story)&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Miriam (short story) (page does not exist)">Miriam</a>" (1945), attracted the attention of <a href="/wiki/Random_House" title="Random House">Random House</a> publisher <a href="/wiki/Bennett_Cerf" title="Bennett Cerf">Bennett Cerf</a>, and resulted in a contract to write the novel <i><a href="/w/index.php?title=Other_Voices,_Other_Rooms_(novel)&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Other Voices, Other Rooms (novel) (page does not exist)">Other Voices, Other Rooms</a></i> (1948). Capote earned the most fame with <i>In Cold Blood</i>, a journalistic work about the murder of a Kansas farm family in their home, a book Capote spent four years writing, with much help from <a href="/wiki/Harper_Lee" title="Harper Lee">Harper Lee</a>, who wrote <i><a href="/wiki/To_Kill_a_Mockingbird" title="To Kill a Mockingbird">To Kill a Mockingbird</a></i> (1960).<sup id="cite_ref-Barra_2-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Barra-2">[2]</a></sup> A milestone in popular culture, <i>In Cold Blood</i> was the peak of Capote's literary career; it was to be his final fully published book. In the 1970s, he maintained his celebrity status by appearing on television <a href="/wiki/Talk_show" title="Talk show">talk shows</a>.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Early_life">Early life</span></h2>
<p>Born in <a href="/wiki/New_Orleans" title="New Orleans">New Orleans, Louisiana</a>, Capote was the son of 17-year-old Lillie Mae Faulk and salesman Archulus Persons.<sup id="cite_ref-ClarkeBio_1-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-ClarkeBio-1">[1]</a></sup> His parents divorced when he was four, and he was sent to <a href="/wiki/Monroeville,_Alabama" title="Monroeville, Alabama">Monroeville, Alabama</a>, where, for the following four to five years, he was raised by his mother's relatives. He formed a fast bond with his mother's distant relative, Nanny Rumbley Faulk, whom Truman called "Sook". "Her face is remarkable — not unlike <a href="/wiki/Abraham_Lincoln" title="Abraham Lincoln">Lincoln</a>'s, craggy like that, and tinted by sun and wind", is how Capote described Sook in "<a href="/w/index.php?title=A_Christmas_Memory&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="A Christmas Memory (page does not exist)">A Christmas Memory</a>" (1956). In Monroeville, he was a neighbor and friend of author <a href="/wiki/Harper_Lee" title="Harper Lee">Harper Lee</a>, who wrote the 1960 novel <i><a href="/wiki/To_Kill_a_Mockingbird" title="To Kill a Mockingbird">To Kill a Mockingbird</a></i>, and based the character <a href="/w/index.php?title=List_of_To_Kill_a_Mockingbird_characters&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="List of To Kill a Mockingbird characters (page does not exist)">Dill</a> on Capote.<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup>
</p><p>As a lonely child, Capote taught himself both to read and to write before he entered his first year of school.<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup> Capote was often seen at age five carrying his dictionary and notepad, and he began writing fiction at the age of 11.<sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7">[7]</a></sup> He was given the nickname Bulldog around this age.<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8">[8]</a></sup>
</p><p>On Saturdays, he made trips from Monroeville to the nearby city of <a href="/wiki/Mobile,_Alabama" title="Mobile, Alabama">Mobile</a> on the <a href="/wiki/Gulf_Coast_of_the_United_States" title="Gulf Coast of the United States">Gulf Coast</a>, and at one point he submitted a short story, "Old Mrs. Busybody", to a children's writing contest sponsored by the <i><a href="/wiki/Press-Register" title="Press-Register">Mobile Press Register</a></i>. Capote received recognition for his early work from <a href="/w/index.php?title=The_Scholastic_Art_%26_Writing_Awards&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="The Scholastic Art &amp; Writing Awards (page does not exist)">The Scholastic Art &amp; Writing Awards</a> in 1936.<sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9">[9]</a></sup>
</p><p>In 1933, he moved to New York City to live with his mother and her second husband, Joseph Capote, a <a href="/w/index.php?title=Cuba&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Cuba (page does not exist)">Cuban</a>-born textile broker, who adopted him as his stepson and renamed him Truman García Capote. However, Joseph was convicted of <a href="/wiki/Embezzlement" title="Embezzlement">embezzlement</a> and shortly afterwards, when his income crashed, the family was forced to leave <a href="/w/index.php?title=Park_Avenue_(Manhattan)&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Park Avenue (Manhattan) (page does not exist)">Park Avenue</a>.
</p><p>Of his early days, Capote related, "I began writing really sort of seriously when I was about 12. I say seriously in the sense that like other kids go home and practice the violin or the piano or whatever, I used to go home from school every day, and I would write for about three hours. I was obsessed by it."{{ safesubst:#invoke:Unsubst||$N=Citation needed |date=__DATE__ |$B=

}} In 1935, he attended the <a href="/w/index.php?title=Trinity_School_(New_York_City)&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Trinity School (New York City) (page does not exist)">Trinity School</a> in New York City. He then attended St. Joseph Military Academy. In 1939, the Capote family moved to <a href="/wiki/Greenwich,_Connecticut" title="Greenwich, Connecticut">Greenwich, Connecticut</a>, and Truman attended <a href="/w/index.php?title=Greenwich_High_School&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Greenwich High School (page does not exist)">Greenwich High School</a>, where he wrote for both the school's literary journal, <i>The Green Witch</i>, and the school newspaper. When they returned to New York City in 1942, he attended the Franklin School, an <a href="/wiki/Upper_West_Side" title="Upper West Side">Upper West Side</a> private school now known as the <a href="/wiki/Dwight_School" title="Dwight School">Dwight School</a>, and graduated in 1943.<sup id="cite_ref-Gerald_Clarke_p.464_10-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Gerald_Clarke_p.464-10">[10]</a></sup>  That was the end of his formal education.
</p><p>While still attending Franklin in 1943, Capote began working as copyboy in the art department at <i><a href="/wiki/The_New_Yorker" title="The New Yorker">The New Yorker</a></i>,<sup id="cite_ref-Gerald_Clarke_p.464_10-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Gerald_Clarke_p.464-10">[10]</a></sup> a job he held for two years before being fired for angering poet <a href="/wiki/Robert_Frost" title="Robert Frost">Robert Frost</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11">[11]</a></sup> Years later, he reminisced, "Not a very grand job, for all it really involved was sorting cartoons and clipping newspapers. Still, I was fortunate to have it, especially since I was determined never to set a studious foot inside a college classroom. I felt that either one was or wasn't a writer, and no combination of professors could influence the outcome. I still think I was correct, at least in my own case." He left his job to live with relatives in Alabama and begin his first novel, <i><a href="/w/index.php?title=Summer_Crossing&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Summer Crossing (page does not exist)">Summer Crossing</a></i>.<sup id="cite_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12">[12]</a></sup>
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Friendship_with_Harper_Lee">Friendship with Harper Lee</span></h3>
<p>Capote based the character of Idabel in <i>Other Voices, Other Rooms</i> on his Monroeville neighbor and best friend, <a href="/wiki/Harper_Lee" title="Harper Lee">Harper Lee</a>,  and was in turn the inspiration for the character Dill Harris in Lee's 1960 bestselling, <a href="/wiki/Pulitzer_Prize" title="Pulitzer Prize">Pulitzer Prize</a>-winning novel <i><a href="/wiki/To_Kill_a_Mockingbird" title="To Kill a Mockingbird">To Kill a Mockingbird</a></i>. Capote once acknowledged this: "Mr. and Mrs. Lee, Harper Lee's mother and father, lived very near. She was my best friend. Did you ever read her book, <i>To Kill a Mockingbird</i>? I'm a character in that book, which takes place in the same small town in Alabama where we lived. Her father was a lawyer, and she and I used to go to trials all the time as children. We went to the trials instead of going to the movies."<sup id="cite_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-13">[13]</a></sup> Later, Lee was his crucial research partner for <i><a href="/wiki/In_Cold_Blood" title="In Cold Blood">In Cold Blood</a></i>.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Short_story_phase">Short story phase</span></h3>
<p>Between 1943 and 1946, Capote wrote a continual flow of short fiction, including "Miriam", "My Side of the Matter", and "Shut a Final Door" (for which he won the <a href="/wiki/O._Henry_Award" title="O. Henry Award">O. Henry Award</a> at the age of 24). His stories were published in both literary quarterlies and well-known popular magazines, including <i><a href="/w/index.php?title=The_Atlantic_Monthly&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="The Atlantic Monthly (page does not exist)">The Atlantic Monthly</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/Harper%27s_Bazaar" title="Harper's Bazaar">Harper's Bazaar</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/Harper%27s_Magazine" title="Harper's Magazine">Harper's Magazine</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/Mademoiselle_(magazine)" title="Mademoiselle (magazine)">Mademoiselle</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/The_New_Yorker" title="The New Yorker">The New Yorker</a></i>, <i><a href="/w/index.php?title=Prairie_Schooner&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Prairie Schooner (page does not exist)">Prairie Schooner</a></i><sup id="cite_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-14">[14]</a></sup> and <i><a href="/w/index.php?title=Story_(magazine)&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Story (magazine) (page does not exist)">Story</a></i>. In June 1945, "Miriam" was published by <i><a href="/wiki/Mademoiselle_(magazine)" title="Mademoiselle (magazine)">Mademoiselle</a></i> and went on to win a prize, Best First-Published Story, in 1946. In the spring of 1946, Capote was accepted at <a href="/wiki/Yaddo" title="Yaddo">Yaddo</a>, the artists and writers colony at <a href="/wiki/Saratoga_Springs,_New_York" title="Saratoga Springs, New York">Saratoga Springs, New York</a>. He later endorsed <a href="/wiki/Patricia_Highsmith" title="Patricia Highsmith">Patricia Highsmith</a> as a Yaddo candidate, and she wrote <i><a href="/w/index.php?title=Strangers_on_a_Train_(novel)&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Strangers on a Train (novel) (page does not exist)">Strangers on a Train</a></i> while there.
</p><p>During an interview for <i><a href="/wiki/The_Paris_Review" title="The Paris Review">The Paris Review</a></i> in 1957, Capote said this of his short story technique:
</p>

<p>The critical success of one of his short stories, "Miriam" (1945) attracted the attention of the publisher <a href="/wiki/Bennett_Cerf" title="Bennett Cerf">Bennett Cerf</a>, resulting in a contract with Random House to write a novel. With an advance of $1,500, Capote returned to Monroeville and began <i><a href="/w/index.php?title=Other_Voices,_Other_Rooms_(novel)&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Other Voices, Other Rooms (novel) (page does not exist)">Other Voices, Other Rooms</a></i>, continuing to work on the manuscript in New Orleans, Saratoga Springs (New York), and <a href="/wiki/North_Carolina" title="North Carolina">North Carolina</a>, eventually completing it in <a href="/w/index.php?title=Nantucket,_Massachusetts&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Nantucket, Massachusetts (page does not exist)">Nantucket, Massachusetts</a>. It was published in 1948. Capote described this symbolic tale as "a poetic explosion in highly suppressed emotion." The novel is a semi-autobiographical refraction of Capote's <a href="/wiki/Alabama" title="Alabama">Alabama</a> childhood. Decades later, writing in <i>The Dogs Bark</i> (1973), he commented:
</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Other Voices, Other Rooms</i> was an attempt to exorcise demons, an unconscious, altogether intuitive attempt, for I was not aware, except for a few incidents and descriptions, of its being in any serious degree autobiographical. Rereading it now, I find such self-deception unpardonable.

<p>The story focuses on 13-year-old Joel Knox following the loss of his mother. Joel is sent from <a href="/w/index.php?title=New_Orleans,_Louisiana&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="New Orleans, Louisiana (page does not exist)">New Orleans, Louisiana</a>, to live with his father who abandoned him at the time of his birth. Arriving at Skully's Landing, a vast, decaying mansion in rural Alabama, Joel meets his sullen stepmother Amy, debauched <a href="/wiki/Transvestism" title="Transvestism">transvestite</a> Randolph, and defiant Idabel, a girl who becomes his friend. He also sees a spectral "queer lady" with "fat dribbling curls" watching him from a top window. Despite Joel's queries, the whereabouts of his father remain a mystery. When he finally is allowed to see his father, Joel is stunned to find he is a quadriplegic, having tumbled down a flight of stairs after being inadvertently shot by Randolph. Joel runs away with Idabel but catches pneumonia and eventually returns to the Landing where he is nursed back to health by Randolph. The implication in the final paragraph is that the "queer lady" beckoning from the window is Randolph in his old <a href="/wiki/Mardi_Gras" title="Mardi Gras">Mardi Gras</a> costume. Gerald Clarke, in <i>Capote: A Biography</i> (1988) described the conclusion:
</p>
<dl>
<dd>Finally, when he goes to join the queer lady in the window, Joel accepts his destiny, which is to be homosexual, to always hear other voices and live in other rooms. Yet acceptance is not a surrender; it is a liberation. "I am me," he whoops. "I am Joel, we are the same people." So, in a sense, had Truman rejoiced when he made peace with his own identity.

<p><i>Other Voices, Other Rooms</i> made <i><a href="/wiki/The_New_York_Times" title="The New York Times">The New York Times</a></i> bestseller list and stayed there for nine weeks, selling more than 26,000 copies. The promotion and controversy surrounding this novel catapulted Capote to fame. A 1947 Harold Halma photograph used to promote the book showed a reclining Capote gazing fiercely into the camera. Gerald Clarke, in <i>Capote: A Biography</i> (1988), wrote, "The famous photograph: Harold Halma's picture on the dustjacket of <i>Other Voices, Other Rooms</i> (1948) caused as much comment and controversy as the prose inside. Truman claimed that the camera had caught him off guard, but in fact he had posed himself and was responsible for both the picture and the publicity." Much of the early attention to Capote centered on different interpretations of this photograph, which was viewed as a suggestive pose by some. According to Clarke, the photo created an "uproar" and gave Capote "not only the literary, but also the public personality he had always wanted." The photo made a huge impression on the 20-year-old <a href="/wiki/Andy_Warhol" title="Andy Warhol">Andy Warhol</a>, who often talked about the picture and wrote fan letters to Capote.<sup id="cite_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-18">[18]</a></sup> When Warhol moved to New York in 1949, he made numerous attempts to meet Capote, and Warhol's fascination with the author led to Warhol's first New York one-man show, <i>Fifteen Drawings Based on the Writings of Truman Capote</i> at the <a href="/w/index.php?title=Hugo_Gallery&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Hugo Gallery (page does not exist)">Hugo Gallery</a> (June 16 – July 3, 1952).<sup id="cite_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-19">[19]</a></sup>

<p>When the picture was reprinted along with reviews in magazines and newspapers, some readers were amused, but others were outraged and offended. The <i><a href="/wiki/Los_Angeles_Times" title="Los Angeles Times">Los Angeles Times</a></i> reported that Capote looked "as if he were dreamily contemplating some outrage against conventional morality". The novelist <a href="/wiki/Merle_Miller" title="Merle Miller">Merle Miller</a> issued a complaint about the picture at a publishing forum, and the photo of "Truman Remote" was satirized in the third issue of <i><a href="/wiki/Mad_(magazine)" title="Mad (magazine)">Mad</a></i> (making Capote one of the first four celebrities to be spoofed in <i>Mad</i>). The humorist <a href="/wiki/Max_Shulman" title="Max Shulman">Max Shulman</a> struck an identical pose for the dustjacket photo on his collection, <i>Max Shulman's Large Economy Size</i> (1948). The Broadway stage revue <i><a href="/wiki/New_Faces" title="New Faces">New Faces</a></i> (and the subsequent film version) featured a skit in which <a href="/w/index.php?title=Ronny_Graham&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Ronny Graham (page does not exist)">Ronny Graham</a> parodied Capote, deliberately copying his pose in the Halma photo. Random House featured the Halma photo in its "This is Truman Capote" ads, and large blowups were displayed in bookstore windows. Walking on Fifth Avenue, Halma overheard two middle-aged women looking at a Capote blowup in the window of a bookstore. When one woman said, "I'm telling you: he's just young", the other woman responded, "And I'm telling you, if he isn't young, he's dangerous!" Capote delighted in retelling this anecdote.

<dl>
<dd>I think I've had two careers. One was the career of precocity, the young person who published a series of books that were really quite remarkable. I can even read them now and evaluate them favorably, as though they were the work of a stranger... My second career began, I guess it really began with <i>Breakfast at Tiffany's</i>. It involves a different point of view, a different prose style to some degree. Actually, the prose style is an evolvement from one to the other—a pruning and thinning-out to a more subdued, clearer prose. I don't find it as evocative, in many respects, as the other, or even as original, but it is more difficult to do. But I'm nowhere near reaching what I want to do, where I want to go. Presumably this new book is as close as I'm going to get, at least strategically.<sup id="cite_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-20">[20]</a></sup>

<dd>A wealthy wheat farmer, his wife, and their two young children were found shot to death today in their home. They had been killed by shotgun blasts at close range after being bound and gagged. The father, 48-year-old Herbert W. Clutter, was found in the basement with his son, Kenyon, 15. His wife Bonnie, 45, and a daughter, Nancy, 16, were in their beds. There were no signs of a struggle and nothing had been stolen. The telephone lines had been cut. "This is apparently the case of a psychopathic killer," <a href="/wiki/Sheriff" title="Sheriff">Sheriff</a> Earl Robinson said. Mr. Clutter was founder of The Kansas Wheat Growers Association. In 1954, <a href="/wiki/President_of_the_United_States" title="President of the United States">President</a> <a href="/wiki/Dwight_D._Eisenhower" title="Dwight D.

The board represents the twelve farm credit districts in the country. Mr. Clutter served from December 1953 until April 1957. He declined a reappointment. He was also a local member of the Agriculture Department's Price Stabilization Board and was active with the Great Plains Wheat Growers Association. The Clutter farm and ranch cover almost 1,000 acres<sup id="cite_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-21">[21]</a></sup> in one of the richest wheat areas. Mr. Clutter, his wife and daughter were clad in pajamas. The boy was wearing blue jeans and a T-shirt. The bodies were discovered by two of Nancy's classmates, Susan Kidwell and Nancy Ewalt. Sheriff Robinson said the last reported communication with Mr. Clutter took place last night about 9:30 PM, when the victim called Gerald Van Vleet, his business partner, who lives near by. Mr. Van Vleet said the conversation had concerned the farm and ranch. Two daughters were away.

<p>Fascinated by this brief news item, Capote traveled with <a href="/wiki/Harper_Lee" title="Harper Lee">Harper Lee</a> to Holcomb and visited the scene of the massacre. Over the course of the next few years, he became acquainted with everyone involved in the investigation and most of the residents of the small town. Rather than taking notes during interviews, Capote committed conversations to memory and immediately wrote quotes as soon as an interview ended. He claimed his memory retention for verbatim conversations had been tested at "over 90%".<sup id="cite_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-23">[23]</a></sup> Lee lent Capote considerable assistance during his research for <i>In Cold Blood</i>. During the first few months of his investigation, she was able to make inroads into the community by befriending the wives of those Capote wanted to interview.

<dd>I spent four years on and off in that part of Western Kansas there during the research for that book and then the film. What was it like? It was very lonely. And difficult. Although I made a lot of friends there. I had to, otherwise I never could have researched the book properly. The reason was I wanted to make an experiment in journalistic writing, and I was looking for a subject that would have sufficient proportions. I’d already done a great deal of narrative journalistic writing in this experimental vein in the 1950s for <i><a href="/wiki/The_New_Yorker" title="The New Yorker">The New Yorker</a></i>...&#160;But I was looking for something very special that would give me a lot of scope. I had come up with two or three different subjects and each of them for whatever reasons was a dry run after I’d done a lot of work on them. And one day I was gleaning <i><a href="/wiki/The_New_York_Times" title="The New York Times">The New York Times</a></i>, and way on the back page I saw this very small item. And it just said, "Kansas Farmer Slain. Family of Four Is Slain in Kansas." A little item just about like that. And the community was completely nonplussed, and it was this total mystery of how it could have been, and what happened. And I don't know what it was. I think it was that I knew nothing about Kansas or that part of the country or anything. And I thought, "Well, that will be a fresh perspective for me"...&#160;And I said, "Well, I’m just going to go out there and just look around and see what this is." And so maybe this is the subject I’ve been looking for. Maybe a crime of this kind is... in a small town. It has no publicity around it and yet had some strange ordinariness about it. So I went out there, and I arrived just two days after the Clutters’ funeral. The whole thing was a complete mystery and was for two and a half months. Nothing happened. I stayed there and kept researching it and researching it and got very friendly with the various authorities and the detectives on the case. But I never knew whether it was going to be interesting or not. You know, I mean anything could have happened. They could have never caught the killers. Or if they had caught the killers... it may have turned out to be something completely uninteresting to me. Or maybe they would never have spoken to me or wanted to cooperate with me. But as it so happened, they did catch them. In January, the case was solved, and then I made very close contact with these two boys and saw them very often over the next four years until they were executed. But I never knew... when I was even halfway through the book, when I had been working on it for a year and a half, I didn't honestly know whether I would go on with it or not, whether it would finally evolve itself into something that would be worth all that effort. Because it was a tremendous effort.<sup id="cite_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-24">[24]</a></sup>

<p><i>In Cold Blood</i> was published in 1966 by Random House after having been serialized in <i>The New Yorker</i>. The "nonfiction novel," as Capote labeled it, brought him literary acclaim and became an international bestseller.
</p><p>A feud between Capote and British arts critic <a href="/wiki/Kenneth_Tynan" title="Kenneth Tynan">Kenneth Tynan</a> erupted in the pages of <i>The Observer</i> after Tynan's review of <i>In Cold Blood</i> implied that Capote wanted an execution so the book would have an effective ending. Tynan wrote:
</p>
<blockquote>We are talking, in the long run, about responsibility; the debt that a writer arguably owes to those who provide him—down to the last autobiographical parentheses—with his subject matter and his livelihood... For the first time an influential writer of the front rank has been placed in a position of privileged intimacy with criminals about to die, and—in my view—done less than he might have to save them. The focus narrows sharply down on priorities: does the work come first, or does life? An attempt to help (by supplying new psychiatric testimony) might easily have failed: what one misses is any sign that it was ever contemplated.<sup id="cite_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-25">[25]</a></sup> </blockquote>

<p><i>In Cold Blood</i> brought Capote much praise from the literary community, but there were some who questioned certain events as reported in the book. Writing in <i><a href="/wiki/Esquire_(magazine)" title="Esquire (magazine)">Esquire</a></i> in 1966, Phillip K. Tompkins noted factual discrepancies after he traveled to Kansas and talked to some of the same people interviewed by Capote.

Tompkins concluded:
</p>
<dl>
<dd>Capote has, in short, achieved a work of art. He has told exceedingly well a tale of high terror in his own way. But, despite the brilliance of his self-publicizing efforts, he has made both a tactical and a moral error that will hurt him in the short run. By insisting that “every word” of his book is true he has made himself vulnerable to those readers who are prepared to examine seriously such a sweeping claim.

<p>True crime writer <a href="/w/index.php?title=Jack_Olsen&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Jack Olsen (page does not exist)">Jack Olsen</a> also commented on the fabrications:
</p>
<dl>
<dd>"I recognized it as a work of art, but I know fakery when I see it," Olsen says. "Capote completely fabricated quotes and whole scenes... The book made something like $6 million in 1960s money, and nobody wanted to discuss anything wrong with a moneymaker like that in the publishing business." Nobody except Olsen and a few others. His criticisms were quoted in <i>Esquire</i>, to which Capote replied, "Jack Olsen is just jealous."
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>"That was true, of course," Olsen says, "I was jealous—all that money? I'd been assigned the Clutter case by Harper &amp; Row until we found out that Capote and his cousin <a href="/w/index.php?title=Template:Sic&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Template:Sic (page does not exist)">Template:Sic</a>, Harper Lee, had been already on the case in Dodge City for six months." Olsen explains, "That book did two things. It made true crime an interesting, successful, commercial genre, but it also began the process of tearing it down. I blew the whistle in my own weak way. I'd only published a couple of books at that time—but since it was such a superbly written book, nobody wanted to hear about it."<sup id="cite_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-26">[26]</a></sup>

<p>Alvin Dewey Jr., the Kansas Bureau of Investigation detective portrayed in <i>In Cold Blood</i>, later said that the last scene, in which he visits the Clutters' graves, was Capote's invention, while other Kansas residents whom Capote interviewed have claimed they or their relatives were mischaracterized or misquoted.<sup id="cite_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-27">[27]</a></sup> Dewey and his wife Marie became friends of Capote during the time Capote spent in Kansas gathering research for his book.<sup id="cite_ref-ReferenceA_28-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-ReferenceA-28">[28]</a></sup> Dewey gave Capote access to the case files and other items related to the investigation and to the members of the Clutter family, including Nancy Clutter's diary.<sup id="cite_ref-ReferenceA_28-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-ReferenceA-28">[28]</a></sup> When the film version of the book was made in 1967, Capote arranged for Marie Dewey to receive $10,000 from <a href="/wiki/Columbia_Pictures" title="Columbia Pictures">Columbia Pictures</a> as a paid consultant to the making of the film.<sup id="cite_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-29">[29]</a></sup>

They found no reported series of American murders in the same town which included all of the details Capote described – the sending of miniature coffins, a rattlesnake murder, a decapitation, etc. Instead, they found that a few of the details closely mirrored an unsolved case on which investigator Al Dewey had worked.

</p><p>Capote was well known for his distinctive, high-pitched voice and odd vocal mannerisms, his offbeat manner of dress, and his fabrications. He often claimed to know intimately people whom he had in fact never met, such as <a href="/wiki/Greta_Garbo" title="Greta Garbo">Greta Garbo</a>. He professed to have had numerous liaisons with men thought to be <a href="/wiki/Heterosexuality" title="Heterosexuality">heterosexual</a>, including, he claimed, <a href="/wiki/Errol_Flynn" title="Errol Flynn">Errol Flynn</a>. He traveled in an eclectic array of social circles, hobnobbing with authors, critics, business tycoons, <a href="/wiki/Philanthropy" title="Philanthropy">philanthropists</a>, Hollywood and theatrical celebrities, royalty, and members of <a href="/wiki/Upper_class" title="Upper class">high society</a>, both in the U.S. and abroad. Part of his public persona was a longstanding rivalry with writer <a href="/wiki/Gore_Vidal" title="Gore Vidal">Gore Vidal</a>. Their rivalry prompted <a href="/wiki/Tennessee_Williams" title="Tennessee Williams">Tennessee Williams</a> to complain: "You would think they were running neck-and-neck for some fabulous gold prize." Apart from his favorite authors (<a href="/wiki/Willa_Cather" title="Willa Cather">Willa Cather</a>, <a href="/wiki/Karen_Blixen" title="Karen Blixen">Isak Dinesen</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Marcel_Proust" title="Marcel Proust">Marcel Proust</a>), Capote had faint praise for other writers.

Although Capote seemed never really to embrace the <a href="/w/index.php?title=Gay_Rights_Movement&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Gay Rights Movement (page does not exist)">Gay Rights Movement</a>, his own openness about homosexuality and his encouragement for openness in others makes him an important player in the realm of Gay Rights nonetheless.<sup id="cite_ref-35" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-35">[35]</a></sup>  In his piece "Capote and the Trillings: Homophobia and Literary Culture at Midcentury," Jeff Solomon details an encounter between Capote and <a href="/wiki/Lionel_Trilling" title="Lionel Trilling">Lionel</a> and <a href="/w/index.php?title=Diana_Trilling&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Diana Trilling (page does not exist)">Diana Trilling</a> — two New York intellectuals and literary critics — in which Capote questioned the motives of Lionel, who had recently published a book on <a href="/wiki/E.M._Forster" title="E.M.

Solomon argues: <blockquote>when Capote confronts the Trillings on the train, he attacks their identity as literary and social critics committed to literature as a tool for social justice, capable of questioning both their own and their society's preconceptions, and sensitive to prejudice by virtue of their heritage and, in Diana's case, by her gender.<sup id="cite_ref-36" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-36">[36]</a></sup></blockquote> By producing works on homosexuality before and after the beginning of the Gay Rights Movement and by openly living as a gay man, Capote became an important representative of the gay community and a leading gay figure throughout the 20th century.

</p><p>In the late 1960s, he became friendly with <a href="/wiki/Lee_Radziwill" title="Lee Radziwill">Lee Radziwill</a>, the sister of <a href="/wiki/Jacqueline_Kennedy_Onassis" title="Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis">Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis</a>. Radziwill was an aspiring actress and had been panned for her performance in a production of <i><a href="/w/index.php?title=The_Philadelphia_Story_(play)&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="The Philadelphia Story (play) (page does not exist)">The Philadelphia Story</a></i> in Chicago.

The adaptation, and Radziwill's performance in particular, received indifferent reviews and poor ratings; arguably, it was Capote's first major professional setback. Radziwill supplanted the older Babe Paley as his primary female companion in public throughout the better part of the 1970s.
</p><p>On November 28, 1966, in honor of <i><a href="/wiki/The_Washington_Post" title="The Washington Post">The Washington Post</a></i> publisher <a href="/wiki/Katharine_Graham" title="Katharine Graham">Katharine Graham</a>, Capote hosted a now legendary masked ball, called the <a href="/w/index.php?title=Black_and_White_Ball&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Black and White Ball (page does not exist)">Black and White Ball</a>, in the Grand Ballroom of New York City's <a href="/wiki/Plaza_Hotel" title="Plaza Hotel">Plaza Hotel</a>. It was considered the social event of not only that season but of many to follow.

</p><p>Despite the assertion earlier in life that one "lost an IQ point for every year spent on the West Coast", he purchased a home in <a href="/w/index.php?title=Palm_Springs,_California&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Palm Springs, California (page does not exist)">Palm Springs</a> and began to indulge in a more aimless lifestyle and heavy drinking. This resulted in bitter quarreling with Dunphy, with whom he had shared a <a href="/wiki/Open_relationship" title="Open relationship">nonexclusive relationship</a> since the 1950s. Their partnership changed form and continued as a nonsexual one, and they were separated during much of the 1970s.
</p><p>Capote never finished another novel after <i>In Cold Blood.</i>  The dearth of new writing and other failures, including a rejected screenplay for Paramount's 1974 adaptation of <i><a href="/wiki/The_Great_Gatsby" title="The Great Gatsby">The Great Gatsby</a></i>, were counteracted by Capote's frequenting of the talk show circuit. In 1972, Capote accompanied <a href="/wiki/The_Rolling_Stones" title="The Rolling Stones">the Rolling Stones</a> on their <a href="/w/index.php?title=The_Rolling_Stones_American_Tour_1972&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="The Rolling Stones American Tour 1972 (page does not exist)">1972 American Tour</a> as a correspondent for <i><a href="/wiki/Rolling_Stone" title="Rolling Stone">Rolling Stone</a></i> magazine. He ultimately refused to write the article, so the magazine recouped its interests by publishing, in April 1973, an interview of the author conducted by <a href="/wiki/Andy_Warhol" title="Andy Warhol">Andy Warhol</a>. A collection of previously published essays and reportage, <i>The Dogs Bark: Public People and Private Places</i>, appeared later that year.
</p><p>In July 1973, Capote met John O'Shea, the middle-aged vice president of <a href="/wiki/Marine_Midland_Bank" title="Marine Midland Bank">Marine Midland Bank</a> on Long Island, while visiting a bathhouse. The married father of three did not identify as homosexual or bisexual, perceiving his visits as being a "kind of masturbation". However, O'Shea found Capote's fortune alluring and harbored aspirations to become a professional writer. After consummating their relationship in Palm Springs, the two engaged in an ongoing war of jealousy and manipulation for the remainder of the decade. Longtime friends were appalled when O'Shea, who was officially employed as Capote's manager, attempted to take total control of the author's literary and business interests.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Answered_Prayers"><i>Answered Prayers</i></span></h3>
<p>Through his jet set social life Capote had been gathering observations for a tell-all novel, <i>Answered Prayers</i> (eventually to be published as <i><a href="/wiki/Answered_Prayers:_The_Unfinished_Novel" title="Answered Prayers: The Unfinished Novel">Answered Prayers: The Unfinished Novel</a></i>). The book, which had been in the planning stages since 1958, was intended to be the American equivalent of <a href="/wiki/Marcel_Proust" title="Marcel Proust">Marcel Proust</a>'s <i><a href="/wiki/In_Search_of_Lost_Time" title="In Search of Lost Time">In Search of Lost Time</a></i> and a culmination of the "nonfiction novel" format. Initially scheduled for publication in 1968, the novel was eventually delayed, at Capote's insistence, to 1972. Because of the delay, he was forced to return money received for the film rights to <a href="/wiki/20th_Century_Fox" title="20th Century Fox">20th Century Fox</a>. Capote spoke about the novel in interviews, but continued to postpone the delivery date.
</p><p>Capote permitted <i>Esquire</i> to publish four chapters of the unfinished novel in 1975 and 1976. The first to appear, "Mojave", ran as a self-contained short story and was favorably received, but the second, "La Côte Basque 1965", based in part on the dysfunctional personal lives of Capote's friends <a href="/wiki/William_S._Paley" title="William S. Paley">William S. Paley</a> and Babe Paley, generated controversy. Although the issue featuring "La Côte Basque" sold out immediately upon publication, its much-discussed betrayal of confidences alienated Capote from his established base of middle-aged, wealthy female friends, who feared the intimate and often sordid details of their ostensibly glamorous lives would be exposed to the public. Another two chapters, "Unspoiled Monsters" and "Kate McCloud", appeared subsequently; intended to form the long opening section of the novel, they displayed a marked shift in narrative voice, introduced a more elaborate plot structure, and together formed a novella-length mosaic of fictionalized memoir and gossip. "Unspoiled Monsters', which by itself was almost as long as <i>Breakfast at Tiffany's</i>, contained a thinly veiled satire of <a href="/wiki/Tennessee_Williams" title="Tennessee Williams">Tennessee Williams</a>, whose friendship with Capote had already become strained.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id=".22La_C.C3.B4te_Basque_1965.22">"La Côte Basque 1965"</span></h3>
<p>"La Côte Basque 1965" was published as an individual chapter in <i>Esquire</i> magazine in November 1975. The catty beginning to his still-unfinished novel, <i>Answered Prayers</i>, marks the catalyst of the social suicide of Truman Capote. Many of Capote's female friends, whom he nicknamed his "swans", were featured in the text, some under pseudonyms and others by their real names. The chapter is said to have revealed the dirty secrets of these women,<sup id="cite_ref-40" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-40">[40]</a></sup> and therefore aired the "dirty laundry" of New York City’s elite. The fallout from "La Côte Basque 1965" saw Truman Capote ostracized from New York society, and from many of his former friends.
</p><p>The chapter from <i>Answered Prayers</i>, "La Côte Basque" begins with Jonesy, the main character said to be based on a mixture of Truman Capote himself and the serial killer victim Herbert Clutter <sup id="cite_ref-41" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-41">[41]</a></sup> (on whom <i>In Cold Blood</i> was based), meets up with a Lady Ina Coolbirth on a New York City street. This woman, who is described as "an American married to a British chemicals tycoon and a lot of woman in every way″,<sup id="cite_ref-42" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-42">[42]</a></sup> is widely rumoured to be based on New York socialite <a href="/w/index.php?title=Slim_Keith&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Slim Keith (page does not exist)">Slim Keith</a>. Lady Ina Coolbirth invites Jonesy to lunch at <a href="/w/index.php?title=La_C%C3%B4te_Basque&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="La Côte Basque (page does not exist)">La Côte Basque</a>. A gossipy tale of New York's elite ensues.
</p><p>The characters of <a href="/wiki/Gloria_Vanderbilt" title="Gloria Vanderbilt">Gloria Vanderbilt</a> and <a href="/w/index.php?title=Carol_Grace&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Carol Grace (page does not exist)">Carol Matthau</a> are encountered first, the two women gossiping about Princess Margaret, Prince Charles and the rest of the British royal family. An awkward moment then occurs when Gloria Vanderbilt has a run-in with her first husband and fails to recognize him. It is only at Mrs. Matthau's reminder that Gloria realises who he is. Both women brush the incident aside and chalk it up to ancient history.
</p><p>The characters of <a href="/wiki/Lee_Radziwill" title="Lee Radziwill">Lee Radziwill</a> and <a href="/wiki/Jacqueline_Kennedy_Onassis" title="Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis">Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis</a> are then encountered when they walk into the restaurant together. Sisters, they draw the attention of the room although they only speak to one another. Lady Coolbirth takes the liberty of describing Lee as ″marvelously[sic] made, like a Tanagra figurine″ and Jacqueline as ″photogenic″ yet ″unrefined, exaggerated″.<sup id="cite_ref-43" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-43">[43]</a></sup>
</p><p>The character of Ann Hopkins is then introduced when she surreptitiously walks into the restaurant and sits down with a pastor. The character Ann Hopkins is likened as Ann Woodward. Ina Coolbirth relates the story of how Mrs. Hopkins ended up murdering her husband: when he threatened to divorce her she began cultivating a rumour that a burglar was harassing their neighbourhood. The official police report says that while she and her husband were sleeping in separate bedrooms, Mrs. Hopkins heard someone enter her bedroom. In her panic she grabbed her gun and shot the intruder; unbeknownst to her the intruder was in fact her husband, David Hopkins (or <a href="/w/index.php?title=William_Woodward,_Jr.&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="William Woodward, Jr. (page does not exist)">William Woodward, Jr.</a>). Ina Coolbirth suggests however, that Mr. Hopkins was in fact shot in the shower; such is the wealth and power of the Hopkins’ family that any charges or whispers of murder simply floated away at the inquest. It is rumoured that Ann Woodward was warned prematurely of the publication and content of Capote’s ″La Côte Basque″, and proceeded to kill herself with an overdose of sleeping pills as a result.<sup id="cite_ref-44" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-44">[44]</a></sup>
</p><p>An incident regarding the character of Sidney Dillon (or <a href="/wiki/William_S._Paley" title="William S. Paley">William S. Paley</a>) is then discussed between Jonesy and Mrs. Coolbirth. Sidney Dillon is said to have told Ina Coolbirth this story because they have a history as former lovers. One evening while Cleo Dillon (<a href="/w/index.php?title=Babe_Paley&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Babe Paley (page does not exist)">Babe Paley</a>) was out of the city, in Boston, Sidney Dillon attended an event by himself in which he was seated next to the wife of a prominent New York Governor. The two began to flirt and eventually went home together. While Ina suggests that Sidney Dillon loves his wife it is his inexhaustible need for acceptance by haute New York society that motivates him to be unfaithful. Sidney Dillon and the woman sleep together wherein afterwards Mr. Dillon discovers a very large blood stain on the sheets, representing her mockery of him. Mr. Dillon then spends the rest of the night and early morning manually washing the sheet with scalding water in an attempt to conceal his unfaithfulness from his wife who is due to arrive home the same morning. In the end Dillon falls asleep on a damp sheet and wakes up to a note from his wife telling him she had arrived while he was sleeping, did not want to wake him, and that she would see him at home.
</p><p>The aftermath of the publication of ″La Côte Basque″ is said to have pushed Truman Capote to new levels of drug abuse and alcoholism, mainly because he claims to have not anticipated the backlash it would cause in his personal life.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Last_years">Last years</span></h2>
<p>In the late 1970s, Capote was in and out of rehab clinics, and news of his various breakdowns frequently reached the public. In 1978, talk show host Stanley Siegal did an on-air interview with Capote, who, in an extraordinarily intoxicated state, confessed that had been awake for 48 hours and when questioned by Siegal, "What's going to happen unless you lick this problem of drugs and alcohol?"  Capote responded with "The obvious answer is that eventually, I mean, I'll kill myself ... without meaning to". The live broadcast made national headlines. One year later, when he felt betrayed by "Princess" <a href="/wiki/Lee_Radziwill" title="Lee Radziwill">Lee Radziwill</a> in a feud with perpetual nemesis <a href="/wiki/Gore_Vidal" title="Gore Vidal">Gore Vidal</a>, Capote arranged a return visit to Stanley Siegal's show, this time to deliver a bizarrely comic performance revealing an incident where <a href="/wiki/Gore_Vidal" title="Gore Vidal">Gore Vidal</a> was thrown out of the Kennedy White House due to intoxication. Capote also went into salacious details regarding the personal life of Lee Radziwill and her sister, <a href="/wiki/Jacqueline_Kennedy_Onassis" title="Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis">Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis</a>.
</p><p>Andy Warhol, who had looked up to the writer as a mentor in his early days in New York and often partied with Capote at <a href="/wiki/Studio_54" title="Studio 54">Studio 54</a>, agreed to paint Capote's portrait as "a personal gift" in exchange for Capote contributing short pieces to Warhol's <i><a href="/wiki/Interview_(magazine)" title="Interview (magazine)">Interview</a></i> magazine every month for a year in the form of a column, "Conversations with Capote." Initially the pieces were to consist of tape-recorded conversations, but soon Capote eschewed the tape recorder in favor of semi-fictionalized "conversational portraits." These pieces formed the basis for the bestselling <i><a href="/wiki/Music_for_Chameleons" title="Music for Chameleons">Music for Chameleons</a></i>, published in 1980. Capote underwent a <a href="/wiki/Rhytidectomy" title="Rhytidectomy">facelift</a>, lost weight and experimented with hair transplants. Despite this brief interregnum, Capote was unable to overcome his reliance upon drugs and liquor and had grown bored with New York by the beginning of the 1980s.
</p><p>After the revocation of his driver's license (the result of speeding near his <a href="/wiki/Long_Island" title="Long Island">Long Island</a> residence) and a hallucinatory seizure in 1980 that required hospitalization, Capote became fairly reclusive. These hallucinations continued unabated and medical scans eventually revealed that his brain mass had perceptibly shrunk. On the rare occasions when he was lucid, he continued to promote <i>Answered Prayers</i> as being nearly complete and was reportedly planning a reprise of the Black and White Ball to be held either in Los Angeles or a more exotic locale in South America. On a few occasions, he was still able to write. In 1982, a new short story, "One Christmas," appeared in the December issue of <i><a href="/wiki/Ladies%27_Home_Journal" title="Ladies' Home Journal">Ladies' Home Journal</a></i> and the following year it became, like its predecessors "A Christmas Memory" and "The Thanksgiving Visitor," a holiday gift book. In 1983, "Remembering Tennessee," an essay in tribute to <a href="/wiki/Tennessee_Williams" title="Tennessee Williams">Tennessee Williams</a>, who had died in February of that year, appeared in <i><a href="/wiki/Playboy" title="Playboy">Playboy</a></i> magazine.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Permanent_hometown_exhibit">Permanent hometown exhibit</span></h2>
<p>Capote's childhood is the focus of a permanent exhibit in Monroeville, Alabama's Old Courthouse Museum, covering his life in Monroeville with his Faulk cousins and how those early years are reflected in his writing. The exhibit brings photos, letters and memorabilia together to paint a portrait of Capote's early life in Monroeville. Jennings Faulk Carter donated the collection to the Museum in 2005. The collection includes 12 handwritten letters (1940s–60s) from Capote to his favorite aunt, Mary Ida Carter (Jennings' mother). Many of the items in the collection belonged to his mother and Virginia Hurd Faulk, Carter's cousin with whom Capote lived as a child. The exhibit features many references to Sook, but two items in particular are always favorites of visitors: Sook's "Coat of Many Colors" and Truman's baby blanket. Truman's first cousin recalls that as children, he and Truman never had trouble finding Sook in the darkened house on South Alabama Avenue because they simply looked for the bright colors of her coat. Truman's baby blanket is a "<a href="/w/index.php?title=Granny_square&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Granny square (page does not exist)">granny square</a>" blanket Sook made for him. The blanket became one of Truman's most cherished possessions, and friends say he was seldom without it — even when traveling. In fact, he took the blanket with him when he flew from New York to Los Angeles to be with Joanne Carson on August 23, 1984. According to Joanne Carson, when he died at her home on August 25, his last words were, "It's me, it's Buddy," followed by, "I'm cold." Buddy was Sook's name for him.

<dl>
<dd>One of the things the movie does best is transport you back in time and into nature. In the early scenes as Joel leaves his aunt's home to travel across the South by rickety bus and horse and carriage, you feel the strangeness, wonder and anxiety of a child abandoning everything that's familiar to go to a place so remote he has to ask directions along the way. The landscape over which he travels is so rich and fertile that you can almost smell the earth and sky. Later on, when Joel tussles with Idabell (Aubrey Dollar), a tomboyish neighbor who becomes his best friend (a character inspired by the author Harper Lee), the movie has a special force and clarity in its evocation of the physical immediacy of being a child playing outdoors.
