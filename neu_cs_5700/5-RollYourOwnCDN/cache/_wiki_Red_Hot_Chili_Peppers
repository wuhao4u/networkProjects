When played live, they incorporate many aspects of <a href="/w/index.php?title=Jam_band&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Jam band (page does not exist)">jam band</a> due to the improvised nature of much of their performances. Currently, the band consists of founding members <a href="/wiki/Anthony_Kiedis" title="Anthony Kiedis">Anthony Kiedis</a> (vocals) and <a href="/w/index.php?title=Flea_(musician)&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Flea (musician) (page does not exist)">Michael "Flea" Balzary</a> (bass), longtime drummer <a href="/wiki/Chad_Smith" title="Chad Smith">Chad Smith</a>, and guitarist <a href="/w/index.php?title=Josh_Klinghoffer&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Josh Klinghoffer (page does not exist)">Josh Klinghoffer</a>, who joined in late 2009, following the departure of <a href="/wiki/John_Frusciante" title="John Frusciante">John Frusciante</a>. Red Hot Chili Peppers have won seven <a href="/wiki/Grammy_Award" title="Grammy Award">Grammy Awards</a>, and have become one of <a href="/wiki/List_of_best-selling_music_artists" title="List of best-selling music artists">the best-selling bands of all time</a>, selling over 80 million records worldwide.<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup> In 2012, they were inducted into the <a href="/wiki/Rock_and_Roll_Hall_of_Fame" title="Rock and Roll Hall of Fame">Rock and Roll Hall of Fame</a>. The band's original line-up featured guitarist <a href="/wiki/Hillel_Slovak" title="Hillel Slovak">Hillel Slovak</a> and drummer <a href="/wiki/Jack_Irons" title="Jack Irons">Jack Irons</a>, alongside Kiedis and Flea.
</p><p>Because of commitments to other bands, Slovak and Irons did not play on the band's debut album, <i><a href="/wiki/The_Red_Hot_Chili_Peppers_(album)" title="The Red Hot Chili Peppers (album)">The Red Hot Chili Peppers</a></i> (1984). <a href="/wiki/Cliff_Martinez" title="Cliff Martinez">Cliff Martinez</a> was the drummer for the first two records (Irons played on the third), and guitarist <a href="/wiki/Jack_Sherman_(guitarist)" title="Jack Sherman (guitarist)">Jack Sherman</a> played on the first. Slovak performed on the second and third albums by the band, <i><a href="/wiki/Freaky_Styley" title="Freaky Styley">Freaky Styley</a></i> (1985) and <i><a href="/wiki/The_Uplift_Mofo_Party_Plan" title="The Uplift Mofo Party Plan">The Uplift Mofo Party Plan</a></i> (1987); he died of a heroin <a href="/wiki/Drug_overdose" title="Drug overdose">overdose</a> in 1988.  As a result of the death of his friend, drummer Irons chose to depart from the group. <a href="/wiki/Parliament-Funkadelic" title="Parliament-Funkadelic">Parliament-Funkadelic</a> guitarist <a href="/w/index.php?title=DeWayne_McKnight&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="DeWayne McKnight (page does not exist)">DeWayne McKnight</a> was brought in to replace Slovak though his tenure was short and he was replaced by <a href="/wiki/John_Frusciante" title="John Frusciante">John Frusciante</a> in 1988. Former <a href="/wiki/Dead_Kennedys" title="Dead Kennedys">Dead Kennedys</a> drummer <a href="/wiki/D.H._Peligro" title="D.H. Peligro">D.H. Peligro</a> was brought in to replace Irons though after a short tenure with the band he was out and replaced by Chad Smith that same year. The line-up of Flea, Kiedis, Frusciante and Smith was the longest-lasting, and recorded five studio albums starting with 1989's <i><a href="/wiki/Mother%27s_Milk" title="Mother's Milk">Mother's Milk</a></i>. In 1990, the group signed with <a href="/wiki/Warner_Bros._Records" title="Warner Bros. Records">Warner Bros. Records</a> and recorded under producer <a href="/wiki/Rick_Rubin" title="Rick Rubin">Rick Rubin</a> the album <i><a href="/wiki/Blood_Sugar_Sex_Magik" title="Blood Sugar Sex Magik">Blood Sugar Sex Magik</a></i> (1991), which became the band's first commercial success. Frusciante grew uncomfortable with the success of the band and left abruptly in 1992, in the middle of the <a href="/w/index.php?title=Blood_Sugar_Sex_Magik_Tour&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Blood Sugar Sex Magik Tour (page does not exist)">world tour</a>.
</p><p>After recruiting guitarist <a href="/wiki/Arik_Marshall" title="Arik Marshall">Arik Marshall</a> to complete the tour, Kiedis, Flea, and Smith employed <a href="/w/index.php?title=Jesse_Tobias&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Jesse Tobias (page does not exist)">Jesse Tobias</a> though after a few weeks he was replaced by <a href="/wiki/Dave_Navarro" title="Dave Navarro">Dave Navarro</a> of <a href="/wiki/Jane%27s_Addiction" title="Jane's Addiction">Jane's Addiction</a> for their subsequent album, <i><a href="/wiki/One_Hot_Minute" title="One Hot Minute">One Hot Minute</a></i> (1995). Although commercially successful, the album failed to match the critical or popular acclaim of <i>Blood Sugar Sex Magik</i>, selling less than half as much as its predecessor. Navarro was fired from the band in 1998.<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup> Frusciante, fresh out of <a href="/wiki/Drug_rehabilitation" title="Drug rehabilitation">drug rehabilitation</a>, rejoined the band that same year at Flea's request. The reunited quartet returned to the studio to record <i><a href="/wiki/Californication_(album)" title="Californication (album)">Californication</a></i> (1999), which became the band's biggest commercial success with 15 million copies worldwide. That album was followed three years later by <i><a href="/wiki/By_the_Way" title="By the Way">By the Way</a></i> (2002), and then four years later by the double album <i><a href="/w/index.php?title=Stadium_Arcadium&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Stadium Arcadium (page does not exist)">Stadium Arcadium</a></i> (2006), their first number one album in America. After a world tour, the group went on an extended hiatus. Frusciante announced he was amicably leaving the band to focus on his solo career. <a href="/w/index.php?title=Josh_Klinghoffer&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Josh Klinghoffer (page does not exist)">Josh Klinghoffer</a>, who had worked both as a <a href="/wiki/Sideman" title="Sideman">sideman</a> for the band on their <a href="/w/index.php?title=Stadium_Arcadium_World_Tour&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Stadium Arcadium World Tour (page does not exist)">Stadium Arcadium tour</a> and on Frusciante's solo projects, joined as lead guitarist in 2009 and the band spent the next year and a half recording their tenth studio album, <i><a href="/w/index.php?title=I%27m_with_You_(album)&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="I'm with You (album) (page does not exist)">I'm with You</a></i>, which was released in 2011 and topped the charts in 18 different countries and included a world tour which lasted almost two years. The band followed up that tour with more shows continuing into 2014 which included an appearance as halftime performers at <a href="/w/index.php?title=Super_Bowl_XLVIII&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Super Bowl XLVIII (page does not exist)">Super Bowl XLVIII</a>. The band plans to start working on their eleventh studio album in 2014.

<p>After losing two of the original band members, Flea and Kiedis started looking for musicians to fill those spots. Shortly after Irons departure they chose as Slovak's replacement <a href="/w/index.php?title=DeWayne_McKnight&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="DeWayne McKnight (page does not exist)">DeWayne "Blackbyrd" McKnight</a>, former member of <a href="/wiki/Parliament-Funkadelic" title="Parliament-Funkadelic">Parliament-Funkadelic</a> and who at one point briefly filled in for Slovak, when he was temporarily fired. <a href="/w/index.php?title=D._H._Peligro&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="D.

Kiedis and Flea had been friends of Peligro for many years and even had a joke band together called Three Little Butt Hairs. With a new lineup set, Kiedis decided to enter rehab to fix his drug problem. Kiedis entered a rehab facility in <a href="/wiki/Van_Nuys" title="Van Nuys" class="mw-redirect">Van Nuys</a> called ASAP. After two weeks into Kiedis' rehab he was taken by his counselor, Bob Timmons, to finally visit Slovak's grave. Kiedis had no desire to be there, however Timmons urged him to talk to Slovak. Within minutes, Kiedis had opened up and could not stop crying. Thirty days later, Kiedis left rehab and was ready to resume his career with the band. Three dates into the tour, McKnight was fired, because the chemistry wasn't there with the other three<sup id="cite_ref-apter224_41-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-apter224-41">[41]</a></sup> McKnight was with the band however long enough to record one song, "Blues For Meister", a song sung by Flea. McKnight was so unhappy about being fired he threatened to burn Kiedis' house down.<sup id="cite_ref-apter173_42-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-apter173-42">[42]</a></sup>
</p><p>Shortly after McKnight's firing, Peligro introduced Kiedis and Flea to a young teenage guitarist named <a href="/wiki/John_Frusciante" title="John Frusciante">John Frusciante</a>. Kiedis actually had met Frusciante a year earlier outside of one of the band's shows. Frusciante was originally directed to audition for the band <a href="/wiki/Thelonious_Monster" title="Thelonious Monster">Thelonious Monster</a>, however Kiedis said right away he knew, that Frusciante was going to be in his band. An avid Red Hot Chili Peppers fan, Frusciante was, according to Flea, "a really talented and knowledgeable musician. He [Frusciante] knows all the shit I don't know. I basically know nothing about music theory and he's studied it to death, inside and out. He's a very disciplined musician—all he cares about are his guitar and his cigarettes."<sup id="cite_ref-apter179_43-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-apter179-43">[43]</a></sup> Frusciante performed his first show with the band on September 17, 1988. The new lineup started right away writing music for the next album and went on a short tour dubbed the <i><a href="/w/index.php?title=Turd_Town_Tour&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Turd Town Tour (page does not exist)">Turd Town Tour</a></i> although in November, Kiedis and Flea felt the need to fire drummer Peligro due to his own various drug and alcohol problems. Much like McKnight, Peligro didn't take the news well. It was Flea's turn to do the firing and it was worse than the band could have imagined. Flea stayed in bed for days after making the tough decision. Years later Kiedis said firing Peligro was one of the toughest things the band ever had to do, however Kiedis became a major part of Peligro's road to sobriety, which began right after he was fired.
</p><p>The Chili Peppers were again without a drummer and were forced to hold open auditions. Denise Zoom, a friend of the band suggested <a href="/wiki/Chad_Smith" title="Chad Smith">Chad Smith</a>, claiming he was the best drummer she had ever seen, that he ate drums for breakfast. The band agreed to audition Smith, however he was late and the last to audition. Kiedis recalled the first time he saw Smith by saying "I spied this big lummox walking down the street with a really bad <a href="/w/index.php?title=Guns_N%27_Roses&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Guns N' Roses (page does not exist)">Guns N' Roses</a> hairdo and clothes that were not screaming I've got style". Smith was a six-foot three-inch tall drummer who, according to Flea, "lit a fire under our asses". From the moment they started jamming, Smith and Flea instantly clicked. The band knew they had their guy. Smith was a hard-hitting musician the Chili Peppers believed they would create a strong relationship with. Kiedis later said the audition with Smith "left the band in a state of frenzied laughter, that we couldn't shake out of for a half an hour". Smith was so much different from the other three. Kiedis, Flea and Frusciante were heavily influenced by the punk rock, where Smith's taste in heavy metal music and biker appearance went against their punk rock views. Kiedis informed Smith he would be hired on one condition. As an initiation to the band, Smith had to cut his long heavy metal looking haircut. Smith refused though Kiedis wasn't about to argue with the much larger Smith.<sup id="cite_ref-apter181_44-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-apter181-44">[44]</a></sup> Smith was hired as the band's fourth drummer on December 3, 1988.

</p><p>The unexpected success instantly turned Red Hot Chili Peppers into rock stars. Frusciante was blindsided by his newfound fame, and struggled to cope with it. Soon after the album's release, he began to develop a dislike for the band's popularity and personal problems between Kiedis and Frusciante began to unfold. Kiedis recalled that he and Frusciante used to get into heated discussions backstage after concerts: "John would say, 'We're too popular. I don't need to be at this level of success. I would just be proud to be playing this music in clubs like you guys were doing two years ago.'"<sup id="cite_ref-59" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-59">[59]</a></sup> The final dates with Frusciante were a mess and Frusciante was so disconnected from the group, often changing the way he played on certain songs, which further got under Kiedis' skin. Unknown to others, Frusciante was also starting his own drug habit at the time and was shutting himself off from everyone except for his girlfriend. Frusciante abruptly quit the band hours before a show during the Blood Sugar Japanese tour in May 1992.<sup id="cite_ref-amgbio_3-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-amgbio-3">[3]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-vh1rhcp_60-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-vh1rhcp-60">[60]</a></sup> The band reached out to <a href="/wiki/Dave_Navarro" title="Dave Navarro">Dave Navarro</a>, who had just split from <a href="/wiki/Jane%27s_Addiction" title="Jane's Addiction">Jane's Addiction</a>, but who was involved in his own personal drug battles.

The performance marked the end of the <i>Blood Sugar Sex Magik</i> tour and Marshall's final performance with the band. The band had planned to begin a follow-up to <i>Blood Sugar Sex Magik</i> with Marshall. However, when it came time to play music, Marshall was always busy, so the band decided that Marshall failed to fit with their future plans and he was dismissed.
</p><p>With Marshall gone, the band decided to hold open auditions (which they considered a huge mess), but which however did lead to an encounter with <a href="/w/index.php?title=Buckethead&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Buckethead (page does not exist)">Buckethead</a>.

<p>Navarro first appeared with the band at <a href="/wiki/Woodstock_%2794" title="Woodstock '94">Woodstock '94</a>. The band opened their set wearing enormous <a href="/w/index.php?title=Light_bulb&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Light bulb (page does not exist)">light bulb</a> costumes attached precariously to chrome metallic suits, making it near-impossible for them to play their instruments. Navarro hated the idea but went with it. The performance saw the debut of new songs such as "Warped", "Aeroplane", and "Pea" although the songs were in the beginning stages and the lyrics were much different than the final versions. The band followed up their performance at Woodstock with a brief tour, which included headlining appearances at the <a href="/wiki/Pukkelpop" title="Pukkelpop">Pukkelpop</a> and <a href="/wiki/Reading_Festival" title="Reading Festival" class="mw-redirect">Reading Festivals</a> as well two performances as the opening act for <a href="/wiki/The_Rolling_Stones" title="The Rolling Stones">The Rolling Stones</a>. According to Kiedis, however, opening for the Stones was a horrible experience.<sup id="cite_ref-64" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-64">[64]</a></sup> While externally, the band appeared to be settled, the relationship between the three established members and Navarro had begun to deteriorate.<sup id="cite_ref-65" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-65">[65]</a></sup> His differing musical background made performing difficult as they began playing together,<sup id="cite_ref-rollingstone2_66-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-rollingstone2-66">[66]</a></sup> and continued to be an issue over the next year. Navarro admitted he didn't care for funk music or jamming. Kiedis was also struggling with his heroin addiction; he had been through a dental procedure in Beverly Hills, in which an addictive sedative, <a href="/wiki/Diazepam" title="Diazepam">Valium</a>, was used; this caused him to relapse, and he once again became dependent on drugs, although the band wouldn't find out this fact for a while.<sup id="cite_ref-p315323_67-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-p315323-67">[67]</a></sup>
Navarro's joining and Kiedis's continued drug addiction had a profound effect on the band and the subsequent sound of their next album, <i><a href="/wiki/One_Hot_Minute" title="One Hot Minute">One Hot Minute</a></i> (1995). With Frusciante no longer present for collaboration, songs were written at a far slower rate.<sup id="cite_ref-p315323_67-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-p315323-67">[67]</a></sup> Working with Frusciante had been something Kiedis took for granted: "John had been a true anomaly when it came to song writing. He made it even easier than Hillel to create music, even though I'd known Hillel for years. I just figured that was how all guitar players were, that you showed them your lyrics and sang a little bit and the next thing you knew you had a song. That didn't happen right off the bat with Dave."<sup id="cite_ref-p315323_67-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-p315323-67">[67]</a></sup> To compensate, Kiedis and bassist Flea took several vacations together, during which entire songs were conceived and with Kiedis often absent from recording due to his drug problems or struggling to come up with lyrics, Flea took a much bigger role in the writing process; coming up with ideas for many songs including full lyrics and even singing lead on his own song, "Pea".

</p><p>Navarro's only album with the band was <i>One Hot Minute</i>, released on September 12, 1995 after many delays and setbacks. Navarro's guitar work had created a stylistic departure in the band's sound, which was now characterized by prominent use of heavy metal guitar riffs and hints of <a href="/wiki/Psychedelic_rock" title="Psychedelic rock">psychedelic rock</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-OHMAMG_68-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-OHMAMG-68">[68]</a></sup> The band described the album as a darker, sadder record compared to their previous material, which was not as universally well-received as <i>Blood Sugar Sex Magik</i>.<sup id="cite_ref-rollingstone2_66-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-rollingstone2-66">[66]</a></sup> Many of the lyrics written by Kiedis were drug-related, including the lead single, "<a href="/w/index.php?title=Warped&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Warped (page does not exist)">Warped</a>," which left Kiedis stunned that nobody else in the band picked up on his lyrics and that he was using again. Broken relationships and deaths of friends and family also played a major role in the album's darker tone and lyrics. The ballad, "Tearjerker," was written about <a href="/wiki/Kurt_Cobain" title="Kurt Cobain">Kurt Cobain</a>, while "Transcending", which was written by Flea, was about longtime friend, <a href="/wiki/River_Phoenix" title="River Phoenix">River Phoenix</a>; and the single "<a href="/w/index.php?title=Shallow_Be_Thy_Game&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Shallow Be Thy Game (page does not exist)">Shallow Be Thy Game</a>" took shots at religion. Despite mixed reviews, the album was a commercial success. Selling eight million copies worldwide,<sup id="cite_ref-Kiedis_2004_401_69-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Kiedis_2004_401-69">[69]</a></sup> it spawned the band's third No.1 single, the ballad "<a href="/w/index.php?title=My_Friends_(song)&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="My Friends (song) (page does not exist)">My Friends</a>", and enjoyed chart success with the songs "Warped" and "<a href="/w/index.php?title=Aeroplane_(Red_Hot_Chili_Peppers_song)&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Aeroplane (Red Hot Chili Peppers song) (page does not exist)">Aeroplane</a>". This iteration of the band appeared on several soundtracks. "I Found Out", a <a href="/wiki/John_Lennon" title="John Lennon">John Lennon</a> cover, was featured on <i><a href="/w/index.php?title=Working_Class_Hero:_A_Tribute_to_John_Lennon&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Working Class Hero: A Tribute to John Lennon (page does not exist)">Working Class Hero: A Tribute to John Lennon</a></i>.

</p><p>The band began its tour for <i>One Hot Minute</i> in Europe on September 27, 1995 and played 16 shows. A US tour was to follow but was postponed after Chad Smith broke his wrist. The band considered carrying on with the tour even at one point considering Jack Irons as a replacement for Smith but there just wasn't enough time to rehearse with anyone new and the dates were rescheduled for early 1996. The band spent most of 1996 playing shows in the United States and Europe. By 1997, for the first time, the band cancelled many shows. Most of this was again due to problems within the band. Flea at that point was exhausted, tired of playing the same songs each night and was seriously talking about quitting the band while Kiedis had recently been involved in a motorcycle accident which left one arm in a sling and created yet another drug relapse due to his use of painkillers. Even Navarro was back to using drugs. 1997 saw the band playing just one show. This was at the very first <a href="/wiki/Fuji_Rock_Festival" title="Fuji Rock Festival">Fuji Rock Festival</a> on July 26, 1997. A massive typhoon hit that day but the band played anyway. They played through an 8 song set before having to cut the show short due to the storm. This would be the final show with Navarro and due to Flea's previous comments left many speculating if it was the end of the band.
</p><p>After making attempts to carry on with Navarro and record a follow-up to <i>One Hot Minute</i> things were not working out and due to Navarro's drug problems and lack of effort in wanting to create new music and chemistry on the road the band felt it was time to part ways. In April 1998 it was announced that Navarro had left the band due to creative differences; Kiedis stated that the decision was "mutual".<sup id="cite_ref-70" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-70">[70]</a></sup> Reports at the time, however, indicated Navarro's departure came after he attended a band practice under the influence of drugs, which at one point involved him falling backwards over his own amp.<sup id="cite_ref-Kiedis_2004_401_69-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Kiedis_2004_401-69">[69]</a></sup>

</p><p><br />
After Navarro's departure in early 1998, Red Hot Chili Peppers were on the verge of breaking up. Flea told Kiedis, "the only way I could imagine carrying on [with Red Hot Chili Peppers] is if we got John back in the band."<sup id="cite_ref-76" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-76">[76]</a></sup> Kiedis was surprised and thought there was no way Frusciante would ever want to work with him as the two still had unresolved personal problems from when Frusciante quit in 1992. With Frusciante free of his addictions and ailments, Kiedis and Flea thought it was an appropriate time to invite him back. In April 1998, when Flea visited him at his home and asked him to rejoin the band, Frusciante began sobbing and said "nothing would make me happier in the world."<sup id="cite_ref-stpg398_74-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-stpg398-74">[74]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-p.408_77-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-p.408-77">[77]</a></sup> Flea decided to contact Anthony and have him meet with John to try and resolve any personal problems that the two might have had.

</p><p>Despite the band's elation, Frusciante was both mentally and physically torn. Frusciante had not played with the band since his departure and other than his solo albums had not picked up a guitar in years. He had lost his guitars in a house fire from which he barely escaped,<sup id="cite_ref-redux_71-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-redux-71">[71]</a></sup> and experienced a difficult time resuming his prior life. The group began jamming in Flea's garage and it didn't take long for Frusciante to regain his talent, however, and new songs began to roll out. Frusciante's return restored a key component of the Chili Peppers' sound, as well as a healthy morale.

</p><p>The band officially began recording their tenth studio album with producer Rick Rubin in September 2010. According to Rubin, the band recorded enough material to release a second double album, following <i>Stadium Arcadium</i> but ultimately decided not to. Rubin notes, "it was painful not to share all of the material that we had, but we felt it would be too much. We really wanted it to be twelve songs but it ended up being fourteen just because nobody could agree on which twelve." The recording process lasted until March 2011. Many of the songs were written between October 2009 and August 2010 and according to Flea around 60–70 songs were written in the ten months prior to entering the studio to record the album. Rubin spoke about Klinghoffer and the new music by saying "Josh is fantastic. He played with John Frusciante for many, many years and he actually toured with the Chili Peppers before, so he's sort of part of the extended family. He's stylistically very close to John but has a completely different trip. It sounds like Red Hot Chili Peppers that you've never heard before." According to Kiedis, the writing and process this time around was much different. In the past many of their songs came through jams, but this time around many were thought out and planned thanks to Flea's new knowledge of music theory.<sup id="cite_ref-114" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-114">[114]</a></sup>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Lyrics_and_songwriting">Lyrics and songwriting</span></h3>
<p>Through the years, Kiedis' lyrics covered a variety of topics, which shifted as time progressed. Early in the group's career, Kiedis wrote mostly comical songs filled with sexual innuendos as well as songs inspired by friendship and the band members' personal experiences. However, after the death of his close friend and band mate Hillel Slovak, Kiedis' lyrics became much more introspective and personal, as exemplified by the <i>Mother's Milk</i> (1989) song "Knock Me Down", which was dedicated to Slovak along with the <i>Blood Sugar Sex Magik</i> (1991) song, "My Lovely Man".
</p><p>When the band recorded <i>One Hot Minute</i> (1995) Kiedis had turned to drugs once again, which resulted in darker lyrics.<sup id="cite_ref-apterspan_184-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-apterspan-184">[184]</a></sup> He began to write about anguish, and the self mutilating thoughts he would experience as a result of his heroin and <a href="/wiki/Cocaine" title="Cocaine">cocaine</a> addiction.<sup id="cite_ref-rollingstonearticle_185-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-rollingstonearticle-185">[185]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-pp265_186-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-pp265-186">[186]</a></sup> The album also featured tributes to close friends the band lost during the recording process including <a href="/wiki/Kurt_Cobain" title="Kurt Cobain">Kurt Cobain</a> on the song "Tearjerker" and <a href="/wiki/River_Phoenix" title="River Phoenix">River Phoenix</a>, on the song "Transcending".
</p><p>After witnessing Frusciante's recovery from his heroin addiction, Kiedis wrote many songs inspired by rebirth and the meaning of life on <i>Californication</i> (1999). He was also intrigued by the life lessons, that the band had learned,<sup id="cite_ref-vh1rhcp_60-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-vh1rhcp-60">[60]</a></sup> including Kiedis' experience with meeting a young mother at the <a href="/wiki/YMCA" title="YMCA">YMCA</a>, who was attempting to battle her crack addiction while living with her infant daughter.<sup id="cite_ref-187" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-187">[187]</a></sup>
</p><p>On <i>By the Way</i> (2002), Kiedis was lyrically influenced by love, his girlfriend, and the emotions expressed, when one fell in love.<sup id="cite_ref-188" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-188">[188]</a></sup> Drugs also played an integral part in Kiedis' writings, as he had only been sober since December 2000.<sup id="cite_ref-189" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-189">[189]</a></sup> Tracks like "This Is the Place" and "Don't Forget Me" expressed his intense dislike for narcotics and the harmful physical and emotional effects they caused him. <i>Stadium Arcadium</i> (2006) continued the themes of love and romance; Kiedis stated, that "love and women, pregnancies and marriages, relationship struggles – those are real and profound influences on this record. And it's great, because it wasn't just me writing about the fact that I'm in love. It was everybody in the band. We were brimming with energy based on falling in love."<sup id="cite_ref-190" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-190">[190]</a></sup> <i>I'm With You</i> (2011) again featured Kiedis writing about the loss of a close friend this time in the song "Brendan's Death Song", a tribute to club owner <a href="/w/index.php?title=Brendan_Mullen&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Brendan Mullen (page does not exist)">Brendan Mullen</a> who gave the band some of their earliest shows and showed support to them throughout their career.
